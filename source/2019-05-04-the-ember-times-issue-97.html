## [EmberFest 2019 CFP is now open! 📝](https://cfp.emberfest.eu)

[EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu/) – the European Community Ember Conference – will be held at [Mogens Dahl](https://mogensdahl.dk) in Copenhagen this year from October 17-18, 2019. They have recently [announced](https://twitter.com/EmberFest/status/1125441719921717251) that the CFP is **now open** with a deadline at August 1, 2019.

EmberFest is looking for a wide range of talks, from in-depth technical talks to broader talks covering other aspects of software development. While Ember-related is best, EmberFest is open to considering talks that cover more general software / tech related topics that would be of interest to Ember developers.

[Submit your talk today!](https://cfp.emberfest.eu/events/emberfest-2019)
