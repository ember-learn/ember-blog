## [Ember Octane Update for Modern Ember Tutorial 🎁](https://codingitwrong.com/2018/08/16/modern-ember.html)

[@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/CodingItWrong) updated his [Modern Ember](https://codingitwrong.com/2018/08/16/modern-ember.html) tutorial to use [octane-app-blueprint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-octane-blueprint).

This tutorial provides an intro to:

- Angle bracket syntax for components
- Easy ES6 imports of NPM modules
- Decorators for clear and expressive component implementations
- Tracked properties to automatically rerender components and recompute derived data
- and Co-locating component templates and classes for easy development

Try out Ember Octane today which [@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/CodingItWrong) calls the “simplest, most straightforward, most productive frontend framework!”

## [RFC for Deprecating Eventing from Ember 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/528)

[@ggayowsky](https://github.com/ggayowsky) asks for your feedback for deprecating the **eventing** pattern from Ember. The motivation stems from the fact that Ember no longer uses eventing, thanks to the work done for [Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/). By deprecrating it, we can [simplify Ember and follow the 2019-2020 Roadmap](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/2018-2019-roadmap/text/0519-2018-2019-roadmap.md#continue-simplifying-ember).

In particular, Gerald [proposes that we target deprecating](https://github.com/ggayowsky/rfcs/blob/deprecate-evented-mixin/text/0000-deprecate-evented-mixin.md) the [`Evented` mixin](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Evented) and methods from [`@ember/object/events`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/modules/@ember%2Fobject#functions-events) and [`@ember/object/evented`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/modules/@ember%2Fobject#functions-evented) packages. If you need to still use the eventing pattern, you could use a [well-supported, third-party library](https://github.com/ggayowsky/rfcs/blob/deprecate-evented-mixin/text/0000-deprecate-evented-mixin.md#transition-path) instead.

For more information about eventing and the plan to deprecate it from Ember, please [check out the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/528) today. Be sure to provide your feedback and help!
