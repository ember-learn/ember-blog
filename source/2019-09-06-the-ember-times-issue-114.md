## [Ember Octane Update for Modern Ember Tutorial 🎁](https://codingitwrong.com/2018/08/16/modern-ember.html)

[@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/CodingItWrong) updated his [Modern Ember](https://codingitwrong.com/2018/08/16/modern-ember.html) tutorial to use [octane-app-blueprint](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-octane-blueprint).

This tutorial provides an intro to:

- Angle bracket syntax for components
- Easy ES6 imports of NPM modules
- Decorators for clear and expressive component implementations
- Tracked properties to automatically rerender components and recompute derived data
- and Co-locating component templates and classes for easy development

Try out Ember Octane today which [@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/CodingItWrong) calls the “simplest, most straightforward, most productive frontend framework!”
