## [A New EmberMap Series: What's New in Ember 📚](https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/)

This year, Ember released many new features that will all be a part of Ember Octane. While the [release notes](https://blog.emberjs.com/tags/releases.html) do a great job of summarizing the features, you may be still wondering about what they are and why they matter to you as a developer or an addon contributor.

To help you understand better, EmberMap started a series called [What's New in Ember](https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/). Each episode will cover 1 new feature, starting with Ember 3.8.

In the first episode, [Sam Selikoff (@samselikoff)](https://github.com/samselikoff) shows how you can write a **modifier**. In particular, you will learn how to use Ember's **modifier manager** (this provides low-level, public APIs for customization) or dedicated addons (for high-level abstraction).

Be sure to check out the future episodes as they are released!
