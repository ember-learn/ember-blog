## [Reusable DOM behavior in React vs Ember 🪔](https://dev.to/rajask05/reusable-dom-behavior-in-react-vs-ember-4p04)

[Raja SK](https://github.com/RajaSK05) wrote a blog post comparing React and Ember's approach to creating reusable components that deal with DOM behaviors. He talks about how to approach the same using the following patterns:

- React's class-based and functional component approach
- Ember's mixin and **modifier** approach.

He also talks about how to use the [ember-modifier](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier) addon if you have been using the Ember mixin patterns so far for DOM behaviors and sharing code between components.

## [Using ember-concurrency with TypeScript 🤝](https://jamescdavis.com/using-ember-concurrency-with-typescript/)

[James C. Davis (@jamescdavis)](https://github.com/jamescdavis) wrote a blog post summarizing how to use [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) with [ember-concurrency](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency) as well as some best practices.

ember-concurrency is an addon that manages asynchronous tasks in Ember applications. The addon traditionally exports a `task` function which is used similarly to a computed property.

```js
import { task } from 'ember-concurrency';

export default Component.extend({
  myTask: task(function*() {
    yield foo;
    return bar;
  })
}
```

The blog post goes through how to use ember-concurrency with Ember Octane and TypeScript. For Octane, we need to use Native Class Syntax. The [ember-concurrency-decorators](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency-decorators) package was created to make this work for ember-concurrency.

However, decorators cannot change the type of the thing they decorate. To allow TypeScript, the [ember-concurrency-ts](https://github.com/chancancode/ember-concurrency-ts) package was created to provide a couple of utility functions such as `taskFor`. 

Finally, the [ember-concurrency-async](https://github.com/chancancode/ember-concurrency-async) package provides a Babel transform that allows you to define ember-concurrency tasks using async/await rather than generator function. This simplifies using `taskFor` on assignment while providing complete type-safety for ember-concurrency tasks.

Read the [full blog post](https://jamescdavis.com/using-ember-concurrency-with-typescript/) with all the tips and tricks and try it out yourself today!
