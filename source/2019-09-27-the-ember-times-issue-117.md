## [Accessibility, Compiler Secrets and Modern Ember @ EmberCamp 🐹](#section-url)


Last week, the Ember community went on an extraordinary trip into the metropolitan wilderness of Illinois:
[**EmberCamp 2019**](https://embercamp.com) took place in Chicago on September 16th and was insightful, exciting and entertaining as always!

With twelve, versed speakers, the schedule offered thoughtful insights into:

- what's new in Ember with its [first edition, Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/)
- how [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider) and Ember will literally build a future together
- everything you need to know to build **accessible JavaScript apps** in 2019
- how to level up your app's **performance** with worker super powers or well-balanced animations
- strategies for stable and reliable test suites
- ...and many, many more topics!

One particular highlight of the camping trip was the ["May I Ask a Question" live event](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/20/meet-the-developer-who-took-stack-overflow-from-screen-to-stage/)
that both [Jen Weber (@jwwweber)](https://twitter.com/jwwweber) and [Preston Sego (@nullvoxpopuli)](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli) led and hosted, answering burning questions from the community.

Missed out on the conference, but still want to catch up before the recordings are out?
Be sure to check out [Jordan Hawker's (@elwayman02)](https://github.com/elwayman02) comprehensive [EmberCamp summary](https://github.com/elwayman02/embercamp), including talk notes and slides for the entire programme.

Can't wait to make it to the camping trip next year? Be sure to let the EmberCamp team know
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/embercamp) or via [old-school e-mail](embercamp.chicago@gmail.com)!
