## [Celebrate the Release of Ember 3.13 (Octane Preview) 🎉](https://twitter.com/kennethlarsen/status/1176948663861620739)

[Ember Octane (3.14)](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) is arriving soon! Today, in 3.13, you can try out all stable features of Octane, including 5 new features:

- Tracked properties (`@tracked`)
- Component co-location (part 1)
- `component-class` generator
- Build-time detection of edition for addon authors
- `updateComponent` hook for addon authors

In addition, version 3.12 of Ember has now been promoted to LTS (Long Term Support). An LTS version of Ember will receive security updates for 9 release cycles (54 weeks) and bugfixes for 6 cycles (36 weeks).

We encourage you to learn more about the new features and migration path to 3.13 by [checking out the official announcement](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/09/25/ember-3-13-released.html). We'd also appreciate your help with completing Octane documentation and testing 3.14 beta against your apps and addons. 💞

## [A newly adopted Ember Addon 🐣](https://twitter.com/Alonski/status/1177577454711582720)

<!--alex ignore white-->
[Adopted Ember Addons](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons) has adopted [ember-sortable](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable), an addon which provides Sortable UI primitives for Ember. The addon was created by [Jamie White (@jgwhite)](https://github.com/jgwhite) over four years ago and he has been maintaining it all this time! The time has come however for the addon to get some new love ❤ under the Adopted Ember Addons umbrella.

The goal of Adopted Ember Addons is to give Ember addons a place to stay maintained when the original maintainer decides that they would like to pass the mantle. The [program guidelines](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/program-guidelines) explain how the program works.

Maintaining these addons takes work by real people. The program is always on the lookout for helpful people to contribute and help maintain these addons. Ember wouldn't be where it is today without the amazing addon ecosystem. If you would like to help out in maintaining these addons, please come join us on [Discord in #adopted-ember-addons](https://discord.gg/emberjs). ❤

## [Accessibility, Compiler Secrets and Modern Ember @ EmberCamp 🐹](http://embercamp.com/)

Last week, the Ember community went on an extraordinary trip into the metropolitan wilderness of Illinois:
[**EmberCamp 2019**](http://embercamp.com/) took place in Chicago on September 16th and was insightful, exciting and entertaining as always!

With twelve, versed speakers, the schedule offered thoughtful insights into:

- What's new in Ember with its [first edition, Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/)
- How [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider) and Ember will literally build a future together
- Everything you need to know to build **accessible JavaScript apps** in 2019
- How to level up your app with *web workers** and meaningful **animations**
- Strategies for stable and reliable test suites
- ...and many, many more topics!

One particular highlight of the camping trip was the ["May I Ask a Question" live event](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/20/meet-the-developer-who-took-stack-overflow-from-screen-to-stage/)
that both [Jen Weber (@jwwweber)](https://twitter.com/jwwweber) and [Preston Sego (@nullvoxpopuli)](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli) led and hosted, answering burning questions from the community.

A huge thank you to those who made this year's EmberCamp possible: kudos to the organizers [Melanie Sumner (@MelSumner)](https://github.com/MelSumner), [Sean Massa (@EndangeredMassa)](https://github.com/EndangeredMassa), [Trek Glowacki (@trek)](https://github.com/trek), [Howie Bollinger (@dbollinger)](https://github.com/dbollinger) and all those who volunteered 🙇‍♂️

Missed out on the conference, but still want to catch up before the recordings are out?
Be sure to check out [Jordan Hawker's (@elwayman02)](https://github.com/elwayman02) comprehensive [EmberCamp summary](https://github.com/elwayman02/embercamp/blob/master/2019.md), including talk notes and slides for the entire programme.

Can't wait to make it to the camping trip next year? Be sure to let the EmberCamp team know
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/embercamp) or via [old-school e-mail](mailto:embercamp.chicago@gmail.com)!

## [Updates to the Ember Octane Guides 🚀](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/editions/#toc_action-on-and-fn)

[Chris Garrett @pzuraq](http://www.github.com/pzuraq) added `@action`, `on`, and `fn` to the [Ember Octane edition guide](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/) and updated it to [match the latest changes to the edition](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1062).

Now the Octane Guides have documentation on how to use the new conventional APIs for creating and adding event handlers and actions to your components and templates:

- The `@action` decorator
- The `{{on}}` modifier
- The `{{fn}}` helper

This [documentation change](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1066) provides much needed information on the benefits and how to get used to using these new APIs.

## [New Feature: Assets Viewer for Ember SVG Jar 📇](https://twitter.com/ivanvotti/status/1174387037983690753)

<!--alex ignore easy-->
[Ember SVG Jar](https://svgjar.web.app/), an addon that lets you easily add SVG images, now features the **Assets Viewer**. Think of Assets Viewer as a hub where you can [meet all SVG images available in your project](https://svgjar-demo.web.app/). You can search for the image that you need and copy the helper code to render that image in your app.

We encourage you to [learn more about Ember SVG Jar](https://github.com/ivanvotti/ember-svg-jar) today. Please thank [Ivan Votti (@ivanvotti)](https://github.com/ivanvotti) for his work!
