<SAYING-HELLO-IN-YOUR-FAVORITE-LANGUAGE> Emberistas! 🐹

This week:

find out how Ember Data has been repackaged in 3.11 📦,
a tutorial to learn how to build an Ember Octane PWA from scratch 🐹,
see EmberJS powered **blogging** in action at DublinJS 🎥,

## [Ember Data Repackaged in 3.11 📦](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0395-ember-data-packages.html)

Starting with Ember 3.11, Ember Data will be shipped as a **collection of small packages** under the namespace `@ember-data`. This helps you import only the packages that you need, identify the API that you can replace, and know where to start if you want to contribute to Ember Data. 🎉

Say hello to the new import syntax:

```
import Model, { attr, belongsTo, hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
```

Previous styles of import will be deprecated in a future release. Don't worry. Before that happens, a codemod and lint rules will be available to help you migrate your code.

We encourage you to learn today about [Ember Data packages in 3.11](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0395-ember-data-packages.html) and the exciting plan to [use Embroider to tree-shake Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/6166).

## [Tutorial: Ember Octane Fundamentals 🐹](https://twitter.com/michaellnorth/status/1148631049141751813)

[@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) published a [new training video series on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ember-octane/) on Ember Octane Fundamentals. If you are not a subscriber to Frontend Masters or prefer written instructions, there are [detailed written instructions hosted in GitHub](https://github.com/mike-north/ember-octane-workshop/tree/master/notes)!

Starting with regular HTML and CSS and going through hands-on experience working with glimmer components, tracked properties, actions, and modifiers – the Ember Octane Fundamentals training provides detailed steps in creating your own server-rendered chat application.

What’s even better is that since this is licensed under the BSD-2-Clause, you can feel free to use this material to conduct workshops in your own groups! Just make sure to give some feedback to [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north)!
