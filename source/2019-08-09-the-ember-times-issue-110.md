## [{{on}} & {{fn}} in Octane Guides 🔥](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912)

**Many thanks** 👏 to [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) and all the other contributors that worked on the **awesome** [PR](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912) updating the preview of the [Ember Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/templates/actions/) section dealing with `@action`, the `{{on}}` modifier & `{{fn}}` helper!

These updates to the Guides relate to event handling, binding of context and partial application of functions, and affect the way that actions are used in Ember Octane.

Check out the PR [here](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912). For more context, see the [blog post](https://www.pzuraq.com/ember-octane-update-action/) from [@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq).

## [Foreign Key Attrs Blog Post 🔑](https://davidtang.io/2019/08/02/handling-foreign-key-attributes-in-an-api-with-ember-data.html)

Ever have issues handling foreign key attributes in Ember Data?

Check out the **clear and concise** [blog post](https://davidtang.io/2019/08/02/handling-foreign-key-attributes-in-an-api-with-ember-data.html) by [@skaterdav85](https://github.com/skaterdav85) that continues his work on Ember Data.

The post includes good patterns that leverage the use of `belongsTo` in Ember Data and the necessary setups for serializers and adapters.

## [Learn All About JAM Stacks Powered By Ember 🍓](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL66D0bR0RQ&feature=youtu.be&t=780)

There are many different roads that lead developers to building fast, secure and performant websites. And one of them is by the means of the **JAM Stack**.

A site built on the JAMstack is often consisting of a mix of **J**avaScript, reusable and/or third-party **A**PIs as well as static, ready-to-render **M**arkup. The one obligatory feature of a JAMstack site, is that it is can be run without a dedicated web server. Common examples of tools that allow you build JAMstack sites are static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, GatsbyJS among many others.

<!-- alex ignore king-queen -->
In his talk **Empress - JAM Stack Templates for Human Beings** at [LeedsJS](https://leedsjs.com/) - [@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) presents static site generation solutions that empower developers and designers alike to create fast and beautiful sites on the web. And surely enough: Empress' site generators are **powered by Ember**! 🐹

Be sure to check out the talk over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL66D0bR0RQ&feature=youtu.be&t=780), give a 👍 and your thoughts in the comments below!

## [Versioned Ember API Links Added to Ember Guides 🔢](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/952)

In the 3.x series, the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/) would send you to the `release` version of the Ember API documentation. Due to changes in Ember and Ember Data, often these redirects would lead you to nowhere.

To fix this issue, [@sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) took on the massive task of updating the links so that **the version of Ember API matches that of Ember Guides when redirected**. (Thank you!) 💖

The next steps are to fix remaining issues with 3.11 links and introduce tests to check for broken links. We appreciate you for your patience. If you notice additional broken links, please let the Ember Learning Team know in the `#dev-ember-learning` channel on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs).

## [Ember Guides Update for Co-Located Templates ☝️](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/977)

[@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) made an update for co-located templates in the [Quick Start](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/) and [Core Concepts](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/core-concepts/) subsections of the [Getting Started](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/) section of the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/).

These changes are part of the work for updating Octane documentation. If you are interested in helping out check out the [Quest Issue for Releasing the Octane Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/669) on GitHub!
