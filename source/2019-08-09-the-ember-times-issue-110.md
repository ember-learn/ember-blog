## [Versioned Ember API Links Added to Ember Guides 🔢](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/952)

In the 3.x series, the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/) would send you to the `release` version of the Ember API documentation. Due to changes in Ember and Ember Data, often these redirects would lead you to nowhere.

To fix this issue, [@sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) took on the massive task of updating the links so that **the version of Ember API matches that of Ember Guides when redirected**. (Thank you!) 💖

The next steps are to fix remaining issues with 3.11 links and introduce tests to check for broken links. We appreciate you for your patience. If you notice additional broken links, please let the Ember Learning Team know in the `#dev-ember-learning` channel on Discord.

## [Ember Guides Update for Co-Located Templates ☝️](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/977)

[@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) made an update for co-located templates in the [Quick Start](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/) and [Core Concepts](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/core-concepts/) subsections of the [Getting Started](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/) section of the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/).

These changes are part of the work for updating Octane documentation. If you are interested in helping out check out the [Quest Issue for Releasing the Octane Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/669) on GitHub!
