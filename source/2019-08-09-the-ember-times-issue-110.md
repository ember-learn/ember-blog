## [Learn All About JAM Stacks Powered By Ember 🍓](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL66D0bR0RQ&feature=youtu.be&t=780)


There are many different roads that lead developers to building fast, secure and performant websites. And one of them is by the means of the **JAM Stack**.

A site built on the JAMstack is often consisting of a mix of **J**avaScript, reusable and/or third-party **A**PIs as well as static, ready-to-render **m**arkup. The one obligatory feature of a JAMstack site, is that it is can be run without a dedicated web server. Common examples of tools that allow you build JAMstack sites are static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, GatsbyJS among many others.

<!-- alex ignore king-queen -->
In his talk **Empress - JAM Stack Templates for Human Beings** at [LeedsJS](https://leedsjs.com/) [@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) presents static site generation solutions that empower developers and designers alike to create fast and beautiful sites on the web. And surely enough: Empress' site generators are **powered by Ember**! 🐹

Be sure to check out the talk over on [Youtube](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL66D0bR0RQ&feature=youtu.be&t=780), give a 👍 and your thoughts in the comments below!
