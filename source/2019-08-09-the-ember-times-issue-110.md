## [{{on}} & {{fn}} in Octane Guides 🔥](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912)

**Many thanks** 👏 to [@NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) and all the other contributors that worked on the **awesome** [PR](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912) updating the preview of the [Ember Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/templates/actions/) section dealing with `@action`, the `{{on}}` modifier & `{{fn}}` helper!

These updates to the Guides relate to event handling, binding of context and partial application of functions, and affect the way that actions are used in Ember Octane.

Check out the PR [here](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/912). For more context, see the [blog post](https://www.pzuraq.com/ember-octane-update-action/) from [@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq).

## [Foreign Key Attrs Blog Post 🔑](https://davidtang.io/2019/08/02/handling-foreign-key-attributes-in-an-api-with-ember-data.html)

Ever have issues handling foreign key attributes in Ember Data? 

Check out the **clear and concise** [blog post](https://davidtang.io/2019/08/02/handling-foreign-key-attributes-in-an-api-with-ember-data.html) by [@skaterdav85](https://github.com/skaterdav85) that continues his work on Ember Data.

The post includes good patterns that leverage the use of `belongsTo` in Ember Data and the necessary setups for serializers and adapters.

For a deeper dive you can also check out [@skaterdav85](https://github.com/skaterdav85)'s [book on Ember Data](https://leanpub.com/emberdatainthewild) and [other blog posts](https://davidtang.io/2019/07/21/embedded-records-in-ember-data-with-json-api.html).
