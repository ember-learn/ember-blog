As a volunteer, you can get:
* A warm welcome to the community

## [Animations and Predictable Data Loading in Ember 🐹](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/)

[@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) a recent attendee at [Ember Conf 2019](https://emberconf.com/) shares an [tutorial](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/) on how to load complex data in a predictable manor and how to use animations to liven up your ember applications. 

The tutorial covers how you can use simple animations using [Ember animated](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated] and [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) to help make your applications feel more dynamic and polished!

Another interesting area the tutorial explores is predictable data loading, overcoming bugs that you may encounter when having models and relationships and how you can use [Ember Data Storefront](https://github.com/embermap/ember-data-storefront) to aid tackling some of this issues! Defiantly worth checking out! 

Read the [full article](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/04/02/animation-and-predictable-data-loading-in-ember/) alongside some video previews or checkout a preview of the [demo app](https://ember-animated.herokuapp.com/) from the tutorial.

## [Dependency Lint RFC ✨](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/464)

[@Alonski](https://github.com/Alonski) proposed that the addon `ember-cli-dependency-lint` be added to the default blueprint.

This lint helps us detect early if our addons rely on the same package but use different versions. In such cases, Ember CLI merges all versions into one. This can cause our app to behave unexpectedly and become hard to debug. 😨😰😱

You can learn about `ember-cli-dependency-lint` addon and how to resolve dependency conflicts at [https://github.com/salsify/ember-cli-dependency-lint](https://github.com/salsify/ember-cli-dependency-lint). Be sure to leave your comments on [the current proposal to include it by default](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/464).
