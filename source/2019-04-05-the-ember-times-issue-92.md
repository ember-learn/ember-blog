## [3 Reasons to Volunteer at a Tech Conference 💪🏼](https://medium.com/@lisaychuang/3-reasons-why-you-should-volunteer-at-a-tech-conference-19a0c81d1d8)

[@lisaychuang](https://twitter.com/lisaychuang) shares her experience from this year’s EmberConf, and encourages newcomers in any tech community to attend a tech conference (and possibly volunteer!)   

As a volunteer, you can get:
* A warm welcome to the community
* Behind the scene access
* A chill home base during the conference

## [{{on}} Modifier RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/471)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) created an [RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/471) to add an {{on}} modifier for adding event listeners to elements based on the [ember-on-modifier](https://github.com/buschtoens/ember-on-modifier) addon by [@buschtoens](https://github.com/buschtoens).

The proposed `{{on}}` modifier will receive the following positional params: the event name, the event listener function and any named parameters as options for the event listener (i.e. capture, once, and passive). Multiple event listeners can also be added to an element by adding the modifier more than once.
