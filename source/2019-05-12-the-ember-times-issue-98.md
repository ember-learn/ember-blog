## [`model` Hook, Illuminated in Ember.js Guides 💡](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)

If you haven't yet, please revisit and share the latest Ember.js Guides on [Specifying a Route's Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/specifying-a-routes-model/)! You will find **beginner-friendly, comprehensive explanation** of what you can do in a route's `model` hook. 💖

In particular, our guide now shows:

- Why we want to use the `model` hook
- How to use `model`, depending on your use case and knowledge of Ember
- How to use **dynamic segments** in `model`
- How to debug `model`

These updates are stepping stones to [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber)'s [major initiative to help developers learn Ember Data easily](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/20). Please thank Jen for her positive work, as well as [@acorncom](https://github.com/acorncom), [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang), [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north), and [@zachgarwood](https://github.com/zachgarwood) for their help with reviews!

## [Jabber away about Javascript 📻](https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1128351412881063937)
A new podcast episode of [Javascript Jabber](https://twitter.com/JSJabber) has been released in which [Sam Selikoff](https://twitter.com/samselikoff) is interviewed by [AJ ONeal](https://twitter.com/solderjs) about **Ember** 🐹. They go into detail regarding how Sam got started working with Ember and they also talked a little bit about the **history of the Ember framework**.

From the [shownotes](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-364-ember-octane-with-sam-selikoff/):
"Sam mentions some of the biggest advantages in using Ember, and what it should and should not be used for. He explains the architecture of Ember apps, addresses some of the performance concerns and then dives into Octane in detail."

So make sure to check it out and [give it a listen 🎧](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-364-ember-octane-with-sam-selikoff/)! You can tell us, and Sam, what you thought on the [#media channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/486955806588403773/) on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS).

## [Do or Donut, there is no Sizzlepie 🍩](https://twitter.com/emberweekend/status/1116022639015940096)

<!--alex ignore king-queen-->
## [Use Empress to render the Ember RFCs 📃](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/489)
<!--alex ignore king-queen-->
[@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) proposed an implementation change to how we currently "render" our RFCs in the [website](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/). The proposed change is to move from using `mdbook`, which provides better formatting for markdown files, to employing [Empress](https://github.com/empress) techniques to render the RFC pages.

In the same proposal, the official URL of an RFC was proposed to move from `https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0425-website-redesign.html` to `https://rfcs.emberjs.com/0425-website-redesign/`. This would then be considered a stable URL and will require us to maintain redirects if we ever change them.

Read and comment more on [GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/489) about the proposed change!

## [A new version of the ember-shepherd addon 🚀](https://twitter.com/shipshapecode/status/1124490696843583490)

[@rwwagner90](https://github.com/rwwagner90) and the crew at [Ship Shape](https://github.com/shipshapecode) have released 🚢 version 5.0.0 of the **ember-shepherd addon**, an awesome site tour library. The updated version includes improved loading speeds⚡️ due to lazy loading with ember-auto-import.

In related news, Shepherd, the JavaScript library that underlies the ember addon that **Ship Shape** also maintains, [has been trending📈 on Github](https://twitter.com/shipshapecode/status/1122673639932014593)!

Check out the new release of ember-shepherd [here](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-shepherd).

## [EmberWork.com ✌️](https://emberwork.com/)
  
We often hear folks say they want to work in Ember, but they can't find an Ember role! There's a new community resource for that—[Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/). Ember Work was built to make things **a little easier** on you. No more scouring LinkedIn or other sources. And no more jobs that are not *quite* Ember. 

Have an open role on your team? Share it on [Ember Work](https://emberwork.com/) for free. (While you're at it, post it on [#ember-jobs](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480523148102467623) on Discord too!) Thanks [@herzzanu](https://github.com/herzzanu) and [@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) for building this resource for the community. 💼

## [FAQs about Ember.js in 2019 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6)

As developers who have worked with Ember for years, we can sometimes forget that we had once approached Ember with a bit of curiosity 😋, a bit of caution 😧, and a bit of confusion 🤕. As Ember approaches its 8th birthday, we want to continue to reach out to the wider JavaScript community, welcome new developers, and help out with their questions.

This week, [@jenweber](https://github.com/jenweber) took her time to [engage a wide audience on Medium](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6) and answer commonly asked questions about Ember. *What companies use Ember? What is Octane? How can I get started with learning Ember?*

We encourage you to [read and share the blog post](https://medium.com/ember-ish/faqs-about-ember-js-in-2019-64efabbf84e6)! If you have time, we encourage you to pen and share your Ember article as well. 🙏
