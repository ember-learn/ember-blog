## [Conditionally Wrapping Components with Ember.js 💝](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js)

Last year, we learned [how to yield an Ember component in multiple places](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/11/26/how-to-yield-an-ember-component-in-multiple-places).

This month, [@baroquon](https://github.com/baroquon) shares **step-by-step instructions** on how to extend this work so that [we can conditionally wrap components](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js).

The best news? With [angle bracket syntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/reference/syntax-conversion-guide/#toc_angle-bracket-syntax), we can dramatically simplify our template! 💯

[Find out how today](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js)!

## [Ember Sinon 4.0.0 Release! 💯](https://twitter.com/JordanHawker/status/1131293493492457472)

Ember Sinon, an Ember CLI addon adding support for Sinon.JS, released a breaking change in [version 4.0.0](https://github.com/csantero/ember-sinon/releases/tag/4.0.0) which includes the latest Sinon.JS release – [Sinon 7.3.2](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/releases/tag/v7.3.2), [EmberJS 3.10](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/21/ember-3-10-released.html), and drops Node 6 support to match the latest [Ember CLI blueprints](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/8563).

[Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org/) provides standalone test spies, stubs, and mocks for JavaScript. It works for any unit testing framework, with [Ember Sinon](https://github.com/csantero/ember-sinon) providing an easy to integration with Sinon.JS.

Try out [Ember Sinon](https://github.com/csantero/ember-sinon) today with `ember install ember-sinon`!

## [Ember CLI Mirage 1.0.0 Release 🎉](https://twitter.com/samselikoff/status/1131306153764380673)

After over four years and 1,442 commits from 174 contributors, [Ember CLI Mirage](https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) has met its milestone 1.0.0 release! Big congratulations to [@samselikoff](https://github.com/samselikoff) and everyone who helped create one of our favorite addons. 🙌

With 1.0.0 (or should we say 💯?), you will find updated documentation and [instructions on how to upgrade](https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade-guide). If you haven't tried out Mirage to mock your backend APIs, we encourage you to today!

## [Ember File Upload 2.7.0 Release 🆙](https://twitter.com/Alonski/status/1128582603894923264)

[Ember File Upload](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-file-upload), which allows **file uploads that continue over a route transition**, announced its 2.7.0 release! You will see updated README (examples using angle bracket) and stability from updated dependencies and bug fixes. 🧡

Please thank [@Alonski](https://github.com/Alonski), [@maxwondercorn](https://github.com/maxwondercorn), [@raido](https://github.com/raido), [@bendemboski](https://github.com/bendemboski), [@hakilebara](https://github.com/hakilebara), and [@andreyfel](https://github.com/andreyfel) for their work on this version!

## [Codemod for ES6 Class Syntax Including Decorators 🤖](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-es6-class-codemod)
Excited about the chance to try out the ✨**native decorator support**✨ announced as part of the [release of Ember.js 3.10](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/21/ember-3-10-released.html)? The good news is there's a [codemod](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-es6-class-codemod) to help you out with that!

Note that this part of the codemod is a configurable option in the transforms. If set to true, it will transform an object's properties to decorators wherever required. Also note that, unless turned off, this codemod will by default handle transforming object properties to class fields.

If you're interested in learning more about the motivation for this adoption of native decorator support in **Ember.js** **3.10** [check out the RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0440-decorator-support.html#motivation).
