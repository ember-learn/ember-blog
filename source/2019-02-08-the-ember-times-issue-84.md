## [🆕 EmberWeekly.com](https://www.emberweekly.com/) 💥

Our friends at **Ember Weekly** launched a new [EmberWeekly.com](https://www.emberweekly.com/). [@ebryn](https://github.com/ebryn) [tweets](https://twitter.com/ebryn/status/1093040993488855040) that the site includes six years of their newsletter's content, fully exposed to the web and now indexable. The site is powered by Ember and Fastboot and will help surface the wondering things happening in the Ember ecosystem! 💛

Looking for Ember resources on the web? A great link to share? Browse the [Reading](https://www.emberweekly.com/?section=Reading) or [Watch & Listen](https://www.emberweekly.com/?section=Watch%2FListen) sections. We think that the site looks pretty slick, too.
