## [Learn what's new in Ember 3.21 release 🎉](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/09/02/ember-3-21-released.html)

The Ember Blog [announced the v3.21 releases](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/09/02/ember-3-21-released.html) of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. The occasion also marked the **LTS release of Ember v3.20**. It will receive [bug fixes until May 2021 and security patches until September 2021](https://emberjs.com/releases/lts).

The release of version 3.21 may affect your development workflow in a few ways:

- `getWithDefault` (both the function and class method) has been deprecated per [RFC #554](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0554-deprecate-getwithdefault.md)
- `ember new --lang` support has landed per [RFC #635](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0635-ember-new-lang.md)
- [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) configuration for addons has been updated to include `ember-lts-3.20` and exclude `ember-lts-3.12`.

The release also kicked off the 3.22 beta cycle. If you can, please help with testing beta builds and reporting bugs before version 3.22.0 is published. 💜

## [Get ready for Hacktoberfest 2020 👩🏽‍💻🧑🏽‍💻](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software. Between October 1 and October 31, you are encouraged to submit **4 quality pull requests to public GitHub repos**. In return, you'll get a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt and stickers (plus knowledge and fun).

If you are an addon maintainer, we encourage you to create issues with a well-defined scope for contributors to jump in and help. Be sure to label the issues with `Hacktoberfest` so that they're easier to discover. You can also tweet issues or repos with the hashtag `#Hacktoberfest`. Last but not least, please follow the [Ember Community Guidelines](https://emberjs.com/guidelines) and provide a welcoming experience to all contributors.

If you are new to open source contribution, we encourage you to be curious and proactive in asking for help. (There is a [`#hacktoberfest`](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/496453502298750988) channel on [Ember Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs).) A repo may provide directions in `CONTRIBUTING` or `README` file to help you get started. An Ember addon that you have used before may be a good place to start; the Ember teams will also provide issues that may interest you.
