## [Tracked Properties RFC Is Up for Review! 👣](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410)

The [Tracked Properties RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/be351b059f08ac0fe709bc7697860d5064717a7f/text/0000-tracked-properties.md) introduces a simpler and more ergonomic system for tracking state change in Ember applications.

Developers can identify if a property or a getter should be _autotracked_  by adding a `@tracked` decorator to it. This allows that value to have its dependencies automatically detected as it is used.

<!--alex ignore special-->
Because tracked properties are just a very thin layer on top of native JavaScript, setting and accessing tracked properties can be done using **standard JavaScript syntax**. With no special syntax, and leveraging existing JavaScript knowledge.

Comment and read more about the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/410).

## [Ten Minutes to Improve JavaScript 📈](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey)

Represent Ember in the [2018 JavaScript Ecosystem Survey](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey)!

Each winter, [npm, Inc.](https://www.npmjs.com/) circulates a survey of software developers and npm users to solicit your feedback and ideas about how to continue supporting the world’s fastest growing developer community and the world’s most popular development language. (Review last year’s results [here](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1).) Be sure to fill out the survey [here](https://www.npmjs.com/2018-javascript-ecosystem-survey) in order to share what you've been working on and how you plan to use JavaScript in 2019. And spread the word!

## [JSON:API Update 1.1 🇯](https://twitter.com/jsonapi/status/1069593631365959680)

**JSON:API 1.1 RC1** is released! 🎉🎊🎈 The spec will hopefully be finalized by January 31 which is very exciting! If you use JSON:API and are able to, try out the upcoming version and give some feedback.

One notable feature is the addition of **"profiles"** which allow specifying addition semantics on top of the current spec. This could allow specifying things like filtering, pagination and more. Check out [profiles here](https://jsonapi.org/extensions/).

Another noteworthy change is the official recommendation to use camelCase for resource fields. This standardization will allow composing and parsing **JSON:API** with JavaScript and other languages. Check it out [here](https://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#naming).

To learn more about the rest of the features and changes in **JSON:API 1.1** check out the [Update History](https://jsonapi.org/#update-history).

## [Set the Future Direction of Linting Ember Apps 📝](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/8219)

In this [work-in-progress draft for restructuring the linting workflow in Ember applications](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/8219) the implementation of
[Ember CLI RFC (Request for Comments) #121](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/121) has begun -
and your **guidance** as part of the Ember community **is needed**!

[Based on the RFC's design strategy](https://github.com/sangm/rfcs/blob/master/active/0000-remove-ember-cli-eslint.md#detailed-design) Ember's **linting** story is about to be aligned with best practices used in the general JavaScript ecosystem.
And there are still decisions to be made: Do you for example expect your linting tests to run
with `ember build` and `ember serve`? How would you linting integrate best into your CI pipeline?

Let [your thoughts on how to swap Ember CLI ESLint for ESLint be known](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/8219) to support the delivery of the best linting solution for the community!
