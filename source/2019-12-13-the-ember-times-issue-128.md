## [Accessible Controls for ember-sortable 🎛️](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-a11y-deep-dive-ember-sortable-yicheng-jerry-gong/)

[Yicheng (Jerry) Gong (@ygongdev)](https://github.com/ygongdev) wrote a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-a11y-deep-dive-ember-sortable-yicheng-jerry-gong/) that documented the process on how we now have [accessible controls](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/issues/269) for [ember-sortable](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable), an open source drag and drop list sort Ember addon.

Unfortunately there was not a well-defined standard for making accessible drag and drop controls from organizations such as the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). He turned to [Andrew A Lee (@drewlee)](https://github.com/drewlee) who created a comprehensive list on what accessible features should be expected on a drag and drop utility and even a [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/drewlee/project/full/XWNLeE). These accessible controls have now landed as part of the [2.0.0 release](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/releases/tag/v2.0.0) of the [ember-sortable](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable) addon. Check out the accessible controls at the [demo page](https://adopted-ember-addons.github.io/ember-sortable/demo/) today!

As part of this work, [ember-sortable](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable) is now part of the [adopted-ember-addons](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons) which is a GitHub org where community members can find a [new home](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/program-guidelines/blob/master/README.md) for their Ember addon. Moreover, ember-sortable was also highlighted on [DecEmber Day 1](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/01/countdown-to-the-new-year-ember-sortable.html)!
