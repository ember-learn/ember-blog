## [Blog: Modal Dialog Using Yieldable Named Blocks 📛](https://balinterdi.com/blog/making-a-modal-dialog-using-yieldable-named-blocks/)

A blog post by [Balint Erdi (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi) goes through how [Named Blocks](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0226-named-blocks.html) allows us to have more than one block when invoking components using the angle-bracket syntax.

With the [Yieldable Named Blocks RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0460-yieldable-named-blocks.html) accepted and the [ember-named-blocks-polyfill](https://github.com/ember-polyfills/ember-named-blocks-polyfill) already implementing it, we can use yieldable named blocks in our Ember apps today. The blog goes through using the `{{yield to=""}}` syntax to implement multiple named blocks in a modal example.

Named blocks are useful anywhere where it makes sense to provide several "slots" that the user of the component can customize. Read the full post today on [Balint’s blog](https://balinterdi.com/blog/making-a-modal-dialog-using-yieldable-named-blocks/)!

## [ember-bootstrap Octane updates 🏎](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap)

[kaliber5/ember-bootstrap](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap) v4.4 was recently released, continuing their incremental Octane rewrite. Tooltips and popovers have been refactored to Glimmer components. 

For ember-bootstrap's 4.x cycle, the overarching goal is to incrementally rewrite all components to Glimmer components. The team is also aiming to replace all computed properties with tracked properties. These changes have been possible because **all components were first refactored to tagless components**. 🌟

Other highlights from ember-bootstrap 4.x include adding Embroider compatibility (including `staticComponents`) and dropping support for subclassing components. As a replacement, users can now build a component library on top of ember-bootstrap, in a change that improves the developer experience.

For more details, check out the [changelog](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
