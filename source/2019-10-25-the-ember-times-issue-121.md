## [Ember Octane Livestream: Build a Drum Machine 🥁](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5znpEiwHpL4)

If you haven't yet, we encourage you to watch [Gavin Joyce (@GavinJoyce)](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) [rewrite his drum machine app in Octane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5znpEiwHpL4). The [original app](http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com) was [written in Ember 1.5 six years ago](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-beats/tree/ember-1.5). Gavin prototypes the new app and gets its features working in 2.5 hours!

From the recording, you will also learn how to:

- Set up Tailwind CSS ([0:06:10](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=370))
- Use a 3rd party library like howler.js ([0:33:46](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=2026))
- Create service to refactor a component ([0:39:04](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=2344))
- Create `hasMany` relationships ([0:50:05](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=3005))
- Prototype the UI ([0:55:36](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=3336))
- Use Ember Concurrency to handle timing ([1:10:58](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=4258))
- Make sounds! ([1:32:30](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=5550))
- Use a helper method to create child records ([1:48:28](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=6508))

## [Make Your Ember App Shine with Glimmer Components ✨](https://mfeckie.dev/glimmer-components-in-ember/)

The release date of Ember's first edition - [Ember Octane](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/08/15/octane-release-plan.html) - is approaching and with it a new way to componentize your app: [Glimmer Components](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0416-glimmer-components.html). They provide a new API to create reusable building blocks for your Ember application. Packed with lots of new features, including argument immutability, [tracked properties](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0410-tracked-properties.html) and Outer HTML semantics, **Glimmer Components** will make it easier for you to manage component state and to deliver high-performant UIs.

Already looking forward to use Glimmer Components in your own app, but don't know how to get started yet? Then this guide on ["Getting Started with Glimmer Components in Ember.js"](https://mfeckie.dev/glimmer-components-in-ember/) is a must read for you. In this article, [Martin Feckie (@mfeckie)](https://github.com/mfeckie) covers the new feature set landing with the Glimmer Components API and best practices for developing modern components with Ember Octane. [Check it out today!](https://mfeckie.dev/glimmer-components-in-ember/)
