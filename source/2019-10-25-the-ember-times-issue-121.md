## [Ember Octane Livestream: Build a Drum Machine 🥁](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5znpEiwHpL4)

If you haven't yet, we encourage you to watch [Gavin Joyce (@GavinJoyce)](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) [rewrite his drum machine app in Octane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5znpEiwHpL4). The [original app](http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com) was [written in Ember 1.5 six years ago](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-beats/tree/ember-1.5). Gavin prototypes the new app and gets its features working in 2.5 hours!

From the recording, you will also learn how to:

- Set up Tailwind CSS ([0:06:10](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=370))
- Use a 3rd party library like howler.js ([0:33:46](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=2026))
- Create service to refactor a component ([0:39:04](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=2344))
- Create `hasMany` relationships ([0:50:05](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=3005))
- Prototype the UI ([0:55:36](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=3336))
- Use Ember Concurrency to handle timing ([1:10:58](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=4258))
- Make sounds! ([1:32:30](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=5550))
- Use a helper method to create child records ([1:48:28](https://youtu.be/5znpEiwHpL4?t=6508))
