## [Glimmer and Ember component performance playground 🚅](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-three-boxes-demo/)

> Using @glimmer/component instead of @ember/component can get you up to 2x speed boosts at almost half the memory consumption.
> [@nullvoxpopuli](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli) ([source](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1335616011744251907))

Play with [the interactive browser demo](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-three-boxes-demo/) or [explore the source](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-three-boxes-demo) behind a performance comparison of Native JS, Ember Components and Glimmer Components. Feel the performance improvements the core team has achieved for yourself! 🔥

## [Ember + Tailwind CSS 2.0 🎨](https://twitter.com/alexlafroscia/status/1330557883566739456)

On the functional CSS train? Now that Tailwind 2.0 is out, you may be looking for guidance on setting it up in your Ember app, as there are some slight differences from Tailwind 1.x. [Ray Tiley (@raytiley)](https://github.com/raytiley/tailwind-ember-example) put together [tailwind-ember-example](https://github.com/raytiley/tailwind-ember-example) to demonstrate how to get things configured in Ember. Check out the conversation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/raytiley/status/1330493161848905730) or chime in on [GitHub](https://github.com/raytiley/tailwind-ember-example) if you have more to add or run into any gotchas!

What's new in Tailwind 2.0? A new color palette, dark mode support, an extra wide 2XL breakpoint, and more. (Note that Tailwind 2.0 is not compatible with IE11, but IE11's end of life is set for 2021.) Check out Tailwind's fancy [release trailer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u_vIdnJYLc&feature=emb_logo) or the [blog post](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2) for more details.
