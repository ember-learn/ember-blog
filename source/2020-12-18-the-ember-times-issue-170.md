## [Glimmer and Ember component performance playground 🚅](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-three-boxes-demo/)

> Using @glimmer/component instead of @ember/component can get you up to 2x speed boosts at almost half the memory consumption.
> [@nullvoxpopuli](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli) ([source](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1335616011744251907))
