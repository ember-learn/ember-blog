## [Lets Send SendAction Away!](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/335)

The time has come. `component#sendAction` has served the Ember community well for years but in a new [RFC by @cibernox](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/335) he proposes to deprecate this feature. In the old days, before v1.13, `component#sendAction` was the only way to **bubble up actions** from components. Since v1.13 we have _closure actions_ which are more intuitive and flexible and they are the current recommended Ember Way‚Ñ¢ for doing actions in components.

_Closure actions_ have been the recommended way to do actions in components for almost 3 years. Also `component#sendAction` is not even mentioned in the guides anymore so there is really little reason to keep it around. So look out for a new deprecation near you, coming soon!

If you want to learn more about why _closure actions_ are preferred over `component#sendAction` then you can check out [this blog post from 2016](http://miguelcamba.com/blog/2016/01/24/ember-closure-actions-in-depth).

## [RFC Deprecating Ember Utils üõ†](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/334)

A new RFC has been posted on deprecating `Ember.{isEmpty, isBlank, isNone, isPresent}`. The motivation of this is to **clean up** utils that do not provide much value over writing plain old Javascript. There's already a discussion going on whether this is a good decision or not. You can follow the discussion and read the RFC at the [RFC repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/334).

## [Global Resolver RFC in Final Process üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è‚Äç](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/331)

The RFC to **deprecate global resolver** is has now entered the final stage. The motivation of this RFC is the fact that we have transitioned to using Ember CLI. The globals resolver is primarily used for Ember without Ember CLI.

Read all about the RFC and bring your thoughts for the final process in the [RFC repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/331).

## [Ember CLI Packager: News from the Field üåæ](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/blob/master/active/0051-packaging.md)

We already wrote about the [Packager in Ember CLI recently](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/05/25/the-emberjs-times-issue-48.html#toc_a-href-https-github-com-ember-cli-ember-cli-pull-7826-a-package-out-for-delivery-to-ember-cli-a). But here's another **status update** for this
feature which will make the **build pipeline** of your Ember apps **easier to modify** very soon:
These weeks lots of new improvements and fixes landed ([1](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7864), [2](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7855), [3](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7848), [4](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/7860)).
According to internal sources, there have already been **successful test runs** using the experimental version of this [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) powered packager üò≤ for bundling and tree-shaking
different open-source Ember üêπ projects.
We'll keep you posted with more news from the field soon!
