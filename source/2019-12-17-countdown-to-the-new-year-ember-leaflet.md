**The first of its kind "Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons" series highlights popular addons in the Ember community. We hope you enjoy learning about fun tools for Ember developers together with us each day!**

## Day 17

In the 17th increment of **Countdown to The New Year** let's take a look at an exciting Ember addon to add **maps** to our apps: **ember-leaflet**!

### What It Does

With `ember-leaflet` we can create useful maps for our web applications. This addon helps us to integrate the functionality of [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly, interactive maps - into our Ember app.

### Why I Like It

Leaflet.js is already a great library built with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. The addon `ember-leaflet` makes the developer experience even better for us: we can build complex, multi-layered street maps directly in our templates using the useful layer components provided by the addon API. This makes creating interactive map experiences much more straightforward and much more fun!
