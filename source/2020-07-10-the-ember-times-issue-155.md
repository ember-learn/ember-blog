## [The 2020 Ember Roadmap 🧭](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/10/2020-ember-roadmap.html)

Hot off the press is [The 2020 Ember Roadmap](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/10/2020-ember-roadmap.html). We highly encourage you to have a look and [share the news](https://twitter.com/emberjs/status/1281726749747949568) with developers in the wider JavaScript ecosystem!

This year, our 2 headline priorities are:

- **Polish the practical and conceptual details of Octane** (tracked properties, Glimmer components, related tooling, accessibility, performance and payload improvements).
- **Make Ember easier to try and adopt. Lower barriers for Ember developers when collaborating with the greater JavaScript project.** We will do this through improvements and simplifications to the framework, and through focused communication with the greater JavaScript community.

There's much more exciting news from the Roadmap than we can possibly include in this newsletter. For more information, please visit the [Ember Blog](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/07/10/2020-ember-roadmap.html)!

## [Release of Ember.js 3.19! 🎉](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html)

The Ember project has released [version 3.19 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html). This release kicks off the 3.20 beta cycle for all sub-projects.

To see a list of updates, we encourage you to visit each project's changelog:

- [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/v3.19.0/CHANGELOG.md#v3190-may-26-2020)
- [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data/blob/v3.19.0/CHANGELOG.md#release-3190-june-5-2020)
- [Ember CLI](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/v3.19.0/CHANGELOG.md#v3190)

As a refresher the [Ember Release Cycle](https://blog.emberjs.com/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html) follows the following:

- Every six weeks: A new stable version of Ember.js
- Every week: A new beta of the next version of Ember.js
- Every day: A new canary build, which is the last successful build of the day
- Every successful build: The ember-latest.js build is updated

To help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time use the [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon to continuously test your projects against the latest releases.

## [Rock & Roll with Ember.js Octane edition is here 🔥🐹](https://twitter.com/baaz/status/1276104785079472130)

There's an updated version of [Balint Erdi's (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi) excellent book Rock & Roll with Ember.js available, now with coverage for Ember's Octane Edition! 🎉

If you have not had a chance to give Rock & Roll with Ember.js a read, you should. This is one of the most well-written books on Ember.js. It's a great way to introduce people who are new to Ember to the framework's conventions.

Using a pragmatic approach of learn-by-building, Rock & Roll with Ember.js takes you through the process of building an Ember application from the ground up. You can expect to finish the book with a solid understanding of the fundamentals involved in building Ember applications.

You can find the book for sale [here](https://www.balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/).

1. Ember Inspector
2. Ember CLI
3. Routes and helpers
4. Sass

## [State of Frontend survey 📊](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/)

Interested in helping Ember.js 🔥 get the recognition it deserves among other frontend tools? You may want to participate in the [State of Frontend Survey](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/).

<!--alex ignore easy of-course-->
This survey aims to assess frontend developers' work. It gives us a chance to provide input on tooling that we use (Ember, of course!). 

It also allows participants the opportunity to comment on tooling they would like to learn and provide thoughts about the future of frontend development trends.

The survey should only take 7 minutes or so of your time. Please help promote the visibility of Ember.js. Your participation can better ensure that the survey provides accurate information about what tools developers use.

Take a moment and fill out the survey [here](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/).
