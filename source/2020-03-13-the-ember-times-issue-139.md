## [EmberConf 2020 is on (and goes virtual) üì∫üéâ](https://emberconf.com/#/emberconf-update-march-12)

Despite the current health situation, resulting difficulties with travel and event restrictions, **EmberConf 2020, March 16th-18th** is around the corner and will definitely **be on**! As usual, you can enjoy inspiring talks about Ember, the web and open-source from community members from all around the world at **EmberConf's first-ever all-virtual conference**!

100% of the conference talks will be delivered remotely at the regularly scheduled time at [emberconf.com](https://emberconf.com/) - ready to watch together with your colleagues and Ember friends. Hangout with other conference attendees at [#ember-conf](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480502413917421570) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs) to share your thoughts on your favorite presentations and do not miss out on your [digital conference swag bag](https://emberconf.com/#/streamer-swag).

For more details on <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> EmberConf goes virtual this year and how you can join from home, please read [the latest conference announcement](https://emberconf.com/#/emberconf-update-march-12)!

Last but not least, we would like to thank everyone involved in the setup of this amazing conference we all love; in particular, we would like to thank and also ask you to please extend a warm thank you to [Leah Silber (@wifelette)](https://github.com/wifelette) who is making this year's awesome EmberConf possible against all odds. If you meet her virtually, be sure to send her a ‚ù§Ô∏è!

## [JHU COVID-19 dashboard is Ember üêπ](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

Did you know that the [popular dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) made by the Johns Hopkins University [Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://systems.jhu.edu/) being used to track cases of the Corona COVID-19 virus is built in part using Ember.js?

As reported by the [CSSE blog](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/), "the dashboard, first shared publicly on January 22, illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. Further, all the data collected and displayed is made freely available, initially as google sheets, now in a GitHub repository, along with the feature layers of the dashboard, which are now included in the ESRI Living Atlas." The data layer Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

While the spread of the virus is concerning and has impacted and will continue to impact many lives, it is inspiring to see Ember being used as a force for good and helping to inform health care providers, researchers, policy makers and the broader public about how cases are developing across the globe.

Thanks to [Rene Rubalcava (@odoe)](https://github.com/odoe) for the [tweet](https://twitter.com/odoenet/status/1233439467421065216) that made us aware.

A mobile friendly version of the dashboard can be found [here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85320e2ea5424dfaaa75ae62e5c06e61).

## [ember-models-table released version 3.0.0 üåü](https://twitter.com/oonechiporenko/status/1235571293530902531)

After nine months of hard work, version 3.0.0 of [`ember-models-table`](https://github.com/onechiporenko/ember-models-table) has been released from beta by [Oleg Nechiporenko (@onechiporenko)](https://github.com/onechiporenko).

This major release includes some breaking changes, so please check the [release notes](https://github.com/onechiporenko/ember-models-table/releases/tag/v3.0.0) when you update. Complementing the release are also new demo's for version 3.x with [Bootstrap 3](http://onechiporenko.github.io/ember-models-table/v.3/bs3/#/examples), [Bootstrap 4](http://onechiporenko.github.io/ember-models-table/v.3/bs4/#/examples), [`ember-paper`](http://onechiporenko.github.io/ember-models-table/v.3/paper/#/examples) and [`plain-html`](http://onechiporenko.github.io/ember-models-table/v.3/plain-html/#/examples).

## [Fast QR Scanning library, ember-jsqr, released! üì∑](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-jsqr/)

Extracted from [@NullVoxPopuli's](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli) [chat project](https://emberclear.io/),
[ember-jsqr](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-jsqr/) is an integration with jsQR, a <span style="font-style: italic;">fast</span> QR code scanner that demonstrates how addon
developers may want to integrate with an external library using **dynamic `import`** to avoid adding to the
initial load cost of an app. The jsQR library itself is 45kb (after min+gzip). This addon adds only <span style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>
to the initial vendor bundle, or the cost of a single Glimmer component, a private service, and modifiers.

QR and barcode scanning without a growth in bundle size (thanks, [ember-auto-import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import)!) is also available in [ember-scanner](https://github.com/evocount/ember-scanner).

## [Ember test case for a CRUD application with Mirage üí°](https://medium.com/@srajas02/ember-test-case-for-a-crud-application-with-mirage-d6d9836bfee2)

[Raja S (@srajas0)](https://github.com/srajas0), who has worked with Ember since 2018, recalls their experience of being unable to find many examples of how to write unit, rendering, and application tests. To help others and future Ember developers, Raja has created [a demo app](https://github.com/srajas0/ember-test-cases) that uses QUnit DOM, ember-cli-mirage, and ember-cli-code-coverage for testing.

We encourage you to [check out Raja's tutorial](https://medium.com/@srajas02/ember-test-case-for-a-crud-application-with-mirage-d6d9836bfee2) and see how you can improve your tests today!

## [Proposing a new API for confident destruction of objects in Ember üí•](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/580)

As Ember developers we benefit from the framework cleaning up after ourselves when components or routes are removed. On top of that, we can even instruct the components we build to carry out additional **teardown instructions**, by [overriding the willDestroy hook (both available in Ember and Glimmer components)](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.17/classes/Component/methods/willDestroy?anchor=willDestroy).

<!--alex ignore host-hostess-->
But even though these APIs are already sufficient to go about our lives as application developers, it is still a limiting way for addon authors to create useful community projects. What if your addon could add teardown work to host apps in a **non-hierarchical** manner, so it can never conflict with other addon's teardown functionalities?

If you want to know the answer to this question, you shouldn't miss out on reading [Chris Garrett's (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) recent **Request for Comments (RFC)** about [Destroyables](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/destroyables/text/0580-destroyables.md) - an API proposal for addon authors and framework contributors. Be sure to join the discussion in the comments section of [the original RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/580)!
