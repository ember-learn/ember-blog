[## EmberConf CFP Brainstorm 🧠⛈️](https://emberconf.com/#/cfp-brainstorm)

This coming [November 14, 2019 at 10:00am PST](https://everytimezone.com/s/970f2362) the annual Ember CFP Brainstorm is happening over [BlueJeans](https://bluejeans.com/241628685/webrtc)!

The session will go through the content of next year’s [EmberConf](http://emberconf.com/) which is happening between March 16-18, 2020. We'll chat about the CFP, the topics we hope to see, and answer community questions about ideas and proposals. The EmberConf 2020 CFP closes on Dec 1, 2019.

Sign up for a reminder on the [EmberConf CFP Brainstorm website](https://emberconf.com/#/cfp-brainstorm)!
