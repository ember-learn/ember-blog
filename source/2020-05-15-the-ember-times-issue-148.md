## [EmberMap: The `{{on}}` Modifier 🔦](https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/the-on-modifier-3-11)

Check out the [new EmberMap video](https://twitter.com/ember_map/status/1255510563163197442) on the `{{on}}` modifier, a new way to attach events in Ember. It can be attached in either a plain HTML element or an Ember component.

```hbs
<Toggle
  @checked={{this.isAdmin}}
  @onChange={{this.toggleIsAdmin}}
  {{on 'mouseenter' this.showTip}}
  {{on 'mouseleave' this.hideTip}}
/>
```

The `{{on}}` modifier accepts two arguments: the event name and the function handler. The **event name** is actually the same argument that the vanilla JS API `element.addEventListener(eventName)` accepts. And the **function handler** is any action, meaning any properly bound function. It can either live on the component instance or be passed in as an argument.

```hbs
<span
  role='checkbox'
  aria-checked={{if this.isChecked 'true' 'false'}}
  {{on 'click' this.toggle}}
  {{on 'keydown' this.toggle}}
>
  {{! additional HTML }}
</span>
```
