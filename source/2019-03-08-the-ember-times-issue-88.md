## [Ember.js Octane Tech Preview  🎥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV09blWlc64)

Check out an awesome new video preview by [@GavinJoyce](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) explaining some of the features and improvements available as part of **Ember Octane**!

The video briefly covers Module Unification and relevant changes to file structure in Ember Octane. Through examples [@GavinJoyce](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) reviews the difference between classic Ember components and Glimmer components in both angle bracket invocation syntax and classic invocation syntax. Also covered are Octane's use of tracked properties vs computed properties, outer vs inner html semantics (div wrapping), tagName(s), classNames, component arguments, splattributes and more.

[@GavinJoyce](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) also calls attention to some nice resources available for learning more details about what's involved in Ember Octane. Watch the [full video, here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV09blWlc64).

## [Release of ember-ajax v5.0.0 🎉](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2019-03-05)

[@Turbo87](https://github.com/turbo87/) announced the [release of version 5.0.0](https://twitter.com/TobiasBieniek/status/1103051224180498434) of [ember-ajax](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax). In this update, we have a **breaking change** for the Error classes since the base class of the custom Error classes was changed to extend native `Error` instead of `EmberError`.

Furthermore, ember-ajax was also updated to use [ember-cli-babel](https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel) v7.x, which requires all apps that uses ember-ajax to use [Ember CLI 2.13 or above](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-ajax#compatibility).

## [Full-Stack Development with Ember and Rails Livestream Series 📹](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong)

Josh Justice AKA [@CodingItWrong](https://github.com/codingitwrong) has a new livestream series on his [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong) where he **builds an application from scratch using Ember and Rails**. Why Ember for this series? Productivity and developer happiness! 💯

These videos will appeal to you if...

* You're a backend developer who hasn't worked with extensive JavaScript before. You'll see how Ember allows you to build rich UIs, without needing to learn a lot to get started.
* You have experience with another frontend framework. You can learn from Ember's approach and gain another perspective.
* You've used Ember in the past. You'll be excited to see recent happenings that make Ember *easier* to use than before.

Check out the [teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCjUBVNng4w) for the series, [Part 1: Deployment, CI, and Dependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sz2AuhWKe0&t=), [Part 2: Models with JSON:API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxA-dDw1Vqo), and [Part 3: UI Libraries and UX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqnrUCCPego). More videos will be released on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-4tbLDX_lmq2f40L0paZw) over the next few Fridays. Better yet, tune into the livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codingitwrong) Fridays at 2pm ET to chat and follow along live!

## [Angle Brackets for All Components 📐](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/459)

A [new Request for Comments (RFC)](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/459) is proposing to make **Angle Bracket Component Invocation Syntax** available for all components in an Ember application - including the **built-in componnents** `link-to`, `input` and `textarea`.

Currently, those cannot be invoked using the modern invocation syntax from Ember's upcoming edition **Octane**, but this proposal attempts to provide ways to do so and circumvent some of today's limiting APIs.

You can read more about the motivation and the detailed design of this change in [the original RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/angle-built-ins/text/0459-angle-bracket-built-in-components.md). Be sure to leave your thoughts!
