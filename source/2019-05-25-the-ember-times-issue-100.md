## [Conditionally Wrapping Components with Ember.js 💝](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js)

Last year, we learned [how to yield an Ember component in multiple places](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/11/26/how-to-yield-an-ember-component-in-multiple-places).

This month, [@baroquon](https://github.com/baroquon) shares **step-by-step instructions** on how to extend this work so that [we can conditionally wrap components](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js).

The best news? With [angle bracket syntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/reference/syntax-conversion-guide/#toc_angle-bracket-syntax), we can dramatically simplify our template! 💯

[Find out how today](https://dockyard.com/blog/2019/05/21/conditionally-wrapping-components-with-ember-js)!

Ember Sinon, an Ember CLI addon adding support for Sinon.JS, released breaking change in [version 4.0.0](https://github.com/csantero/ember-sinon/releases/tag/4.0.0) which includes the latest Sinon.JS release – [Sinon 7.3.2](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon/releases/tag/v7.3.2), [EmberJS 3.10](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/21/ember-3-10-released.html), and drops Node 6 support to match the latest [Ember CLI blueprints](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/8563).
