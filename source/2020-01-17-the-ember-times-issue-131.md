## [4 RFCs on improving Ember's autotracking and reactivity system üí¨](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/use-and-resources/text/0567-use-and-resources.md#introducing-use-and-resources)

Ember Octane features a **new reactivity system** thanks to **tracked properties**. They simplify syncing the DOM with JavaScript changes. Find out how autotracking works from the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/autotracking-in-depth/).

To help address some shortcomings, [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) proposed introducing the decorators and classes listed below. We encourage you to participate in RFCs and provide feedback!

### [566. `@memo` decorator](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/566)

Unlike computed properties, autotracked getters don't cache their values. `@memo` will let you opt in to memoization.

### [567. `@use` decorator](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/567)

The `@use` API will leverage autotracking to solve two issues:

- Allow Glimmer components to define a behavior with its own lifecycle, independently of the template
- Provide a standard way to mix declarative and imperative code

### [569. `TrackedList` class](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/569)

`TrackedList` will autotrack changes to arrays. This class, designed to replace `EmberArray`, will follow the native array API closely and be performant.

### [577. `TrackedMap` and `TrackedSet` classes](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/577)

`TrackedMap` and `TrackedSet`, along with their weak analogs, will autotrack changes to maps and sets (dynamic collections of values). These classes will follow the native APIs exactly.

## [New test waiters RFC ‚è≥](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/581)

<!--alex ignore waiters-waitresses-->
[Steve Calvert (@scalvert)](https://github.com/scalvert) proposed replacing the existing test waiters with the [ember-test-waiters](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-test-waiters) in the [New Test Waiters RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/581).


<!--alex ignore waiter-waitress-->
The new test waiter system will provide a few benefits:

<!--alex ignore waiter-waitress waiters-waitresses-->
- A **new API that removes the existing foot guns** given we will be more explicit when declaring the start and end of the waiter through the waiter `beginAsync` and `endAsync` methods
- A more robust way to gather **debugging information** for the test waiter since the waiter is identifiable by the name provided
- Default test waiters with the **ability to author your own, more complex test waiters** through annotating the asynchronous operations in your code base that are not tracked by an `await settled()` check

## [Optimizing your app with Ember Data üìà](https://runspired.com/2019/12/15/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data/)

[Chris Thoburn (@runspired)](https://github.com/runspired) is blogging about how to build and optimize an app with Ember Data. You'll start by building an app, Listicle. Listicle starts as a small app shell with rich content lists, but balloons in size over time. Build times slow to a crawl as a result.

At the beginning of the series, Listicle builds and renders in greater than 5 seconds. But as the posts progress, you'll end with an app with builds and renders in **less than 1 second** by optimizing only the app's data management! Then for fun, you'll optimize the render.

You can check out [Part 1](https://runspired.com/2019/12/15/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data/) and [Part 2](https://runspired.com/2019/12/18/optimizing-your-app-with-ember-data-part-2/) now, with more posts to come! And you can follow along with the code for the series by watching the [Listicle repository](https://github.com/runspired/listicle).

For some Ember Data context, check out the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/). You can learn about the architecture and history in Chris's EmberFest [Ember Data 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqbsOyLM30&list=PLN4SpDLOSVkT0e094BZhGkUnf2WBF09xx&index=23&t=0s) conference talk.

## [Russian Ember community üá∑üá∫](https://habr.com/ru/post/483630/)

[Habr.com](https://habr.com/) is a popular geek media site among Russian developers. It's somewhat similar to Hacker News, except that it's populated by user-submitted articles instead of links. [Iaroslav Popov (@chilicoder)](https://github.com/chilicoder) recognized a shortage of Ember articles on Habr.com and recently started translating our very own Ember Times ([Issue #129](https://habr.com/ru/post/482988/), [Issue #130](https://habr.com/ru/post/483630/)) on Habr.com, as well as [Octane is Here](https://habr.com/ru/post/482158/) and [Super Rentals tutorial - Part 1](https://habr.com/ru/post/482296/)!

@chilicoder also mentioned to check out the [Ember telegram channel](https://t.me/ember_js), moderated by [Alex Kanunnikov (@lifeart)](https://github.com/lifeart). It's one of the best ways to get help with **Ember in Russian**, and they welcome everyone to join! Thank you both for your help in fostering the Russian Ember community!

## [Master powerful debugging strategies at EmberConf üíª](https://emberconf.com/#/speakers/samanta-de-barros)

You've undoubtedly heard her talk about [creating progressive web applications with Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR1Tk_bwmZo)
and [bulletproof addon testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31kVznd-zys) before, but now [Samanta de Barros (@sdebarros)](https://github.com/sdebarros)
is ready to share more useful knowledge that is crucial for any professional JavaScript developer.

At [this year's EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/) she's going to teach us about [**The Power of Debugging**](https://emberconf.com/#/speakers/samanta-de-barros); which tools you can use to track down bugs swiftly in development and production environments, and how you can find your way around Ember's architecture while doing so.

In an exclusive interview with The Ember Times, Samanta shares with us, what makes debugging tools and strategies so powerful when developing Ember applications:

<!--alex ignore fear just-->
> I think learning about debugging techniques is important. Mostly, because it will help you to have a better time finding bugs and even how an app works. In part I think it‚Äôs necessary because it will help you on your job!
>
> I also think that when you start looking at other people‚Äôs code it is hard at first, but after a while you lose the fear of seeing these complex frameworks, you get a better idea of everything and you start to realise - it‚Äôs just JavaScript in the end. So I think debugging techniques are good for finding bugs and demystifying frameworks.

What's our experience like when we start to learn more about debugging strategies? Here, Samanta can share from both her own experience and from those she worked together with:

> When you are pairing with someone or you‚Äôre trying to solve an issue, you often run into something and it makes people go like: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs interesting!‚Äù When I‚Äôve seen other people‚Äôs talks or see them working, I see that they have some tips about things that I don‚Äôt know about yet and that‚Äôs cool! You realise that there are a lot of tools that make working with the frontend easier.
>
> People who learn more about debugging usually say: ‚ÄúOh yeah, that‚Äôs cool, that really simplifies these tasks I need to do‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt know you could find that information there in the app.‚Äù

EmberConf is a unique experience, one that you and your team should definitely not miss out on. Samanta shares her perspective on what makes the conference
so outstanding:

<!--alex ignore just-->
> I think it‚Äôs a different experience when you go to a conference as a speaker or as attendee. When you just go to listen to the talks, you get a lot of inspiration, you discover things that people are you doing that you might not do yet and it sparks something in you that makes you want to learn something new or improve something in your job. [‚Ä¶]
>
> I would say both getting inspiration and connecting are the nicest things about EmberConf. If I had to recommend anything to an attendee, I‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúJust go and ask questions to the other attendees or speakers.‚Äù Just listening to the talks is good enough, but the chance to connect with others makes the conference really great.

If you want to learn more about successfully debugging Ember apps, join more than 800 other Ember developers at [EmberConf in Portland, OR from March 16 - 18, 2020](https://emberconf.com/). Prices for regular attendee tickets start from $449, so don't hesitate to [register today](https://emberconf.com/#/register)!
