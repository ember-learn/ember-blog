## [Switching from ember-data to ember-orbit 💡](https://medium.com/swlh/switching-from-ember-data-to-ember-orbit-82e202248f1c)

[Derek Gray (@derekwsgray)](https://github.com/derekwsgray) encountered a business requirement to provide an Undo/Redo feature in a large Ember app. While gradually updating the app to rely on [ember-orbit](https://github.com/orbitjs/ember-orbit), Derek recorded [tips and changes that you will want to consider](https://medium.com/swlh/switching-from-ember-data-to-ember-orbit-82e202248f1c) when you are in a similar situation. Perhaps you will want to leverage other Orbit features (offline cache, transaction logs, background sync strategies).

The blog post provides:

- A list of introductory reference materials
- How to allow `ember-data` and `ember-orbit` to coexist during migration
- How to convert `ember-data` syntax to `ember-orbit`

We encourage you to check it out and bookmark the link for future reference!
