## [Podcast: The New Ember with Mike North 🎙️](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-395-the-new-ember-with-mike-north/)

A recent [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) podcast had [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) discussing the “New Ember” and how it is a lot more approachable now. This “New Ember”, or [Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/), brings Ember from having the steepest learning curve of the popular JavaScript frameworks to hardly having to learn anything at all.

Mike also talks about how Ember provides stability for developers using them by having a long track record for providing tools and education to make the upgrade seamless and even have old components living next to brand new ones with updated syntax. As a testament to this, Mike mentions that his original Frontend Masters course – Intro to Ember – that was recorded in 2015 only required very minor changes to update it to the [version we have today](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/ember-octane/).

Listen to the full podcast on [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/jsj-395-the-new-ember-with-mike-north/)!
