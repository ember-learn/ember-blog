## [The Ember.js Testing Guide, I Made for Myself 💡](https://medium.com/@sarbbottam/the-ember-js-testing-guide-i-made-for-myself-c9a073a0c718)

[@sarbbottam](https://github.com/sarbbottam) recalls how the [new testing syntax](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/testing/) had improved his productivity remarkably. Sarbbottam, who has been making notes on testing since, [graciously shared them with the whole community last week](https://medium.com/@sarbbottam/the-ember-js-testing-guide-i-made-for-myself-c9a073a0c718). 💯

Learn more today about:

- Writing different types of tests (unit, integration, and acceptance)
- Running tests
- Stubbing dependencies

We encourage you to **check out Sarbbottam's guide** and **share** it with developers that you know! 💛

## [Do We Still Need the Input Helper? 🤔](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Rl6o9wLX0)

As Ember aligns with native JavaScript more each day, we get to reexamine the framework choices that we had made. For example, how should we handle events for **input elements**? [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) and [@stefanpenner](https://github.com/stefanpenner) met to **discuss** the historical context and alternatives to using the `{{input}}` helper.

You can learn more from their [recorded interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Rl6o9wLX0) and [@balinterdi](https://github.com/balinterdi)'s [notes and thoughts](http://www.balinterdi.com/blog/built-in-input-helpers-in-ember-js-when-and-whether-they-should-be-used/).

## [Talk Video: Visual Regression Testing Made Easy 📺](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZCJNeybbs)

[@patocallaghan](https://github.com/patocallaghan) gave a lightning talk on **“Visual Regression Testing Made Easy”** at the April 2019 [DublinJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/). In his talk, Pat used [Percy](https://percy.io/) to scale visual regression testing from a manual to an automated workflow. You can catch potential CSS bugs, remove certain types of tests, and deal with large refactors and migrations. _“Styles can sometimes make bad things happen.”_ Percy gives you confidence when you make big changes.

Check out the [full lightning talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ZCJNeybbs) just published this week!

## [More Explicit Dependency Injection in Your Ember Apps 🐹](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/502)

The [**recent Request for Comments (RFC)**](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/502), titled "Explicit Service Injection," proposes an update to the way **services and other dependencies** are registered, looked up and **injected** in Ember apps. The proposal argues that a class-based syntax for [dependency injection](https://guides.emberjs.com/v3.10.0/applications/dependency-injection/) is more explicit than the current string-based API and therefore preferable.

If you'd like to learn more about the **new API design** that is proposed in the RFC, be sure to [read the original proposal](https://github.com/nullvoxpopuli/rfcs/blob/explicit-dependency-injection/text/0000-explicit-dependency-injection.md) and do not forget to **join the discussion** in the comments!

## [Prune Your App with Ember Unused Components ♻️](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components)

Finding **components** that aren't used in your application anymore can be tough. Due to different ways to invoke components (with curly braces or [angle brackets](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/reference/syntax-conversion-guide/)) and the syntactical ambiguity between invoking helpers and components, it takes some time to prune your app from redundant components manually.

But now you can use the brand-new addon [Ember Unused Components](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components) to **clean up** your **codebase automatically**. Use the `--stats` flag to get **useful reports** on the impact of your app optimization efforts as you go. [Check it out today!](https://github.com/vastec/ember-unused-components)
