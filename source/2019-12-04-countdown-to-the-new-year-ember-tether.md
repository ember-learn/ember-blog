**May the 4th edition in our December series be with you! In "Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons" we highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 4

Today we are going to take a look at [ember-tether](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-tether).

### What It Does

The addon **ember-tether** provides us with a UI component that - once rendered - will render its **block** to any other target DOM node on the page as configured via the component's attributes. This "tethering" of the component's block to a target somewhere else on the page also retains the component's context - making Ember action handling and data binding possible.

### Why I Like It

Even though we have a lot of control over how and where Ember apps render UI using routes and components, it's sometimes difficult to implement less conventional UI patterns such as interactive modal dialogs or tooltips for street maps without writing lots of boilerplate. I enjoy using ember-tether for giving me the freedom to render app content wherever I like, almost whenever I want to.

Do you already use Ember Tether or another addon that allows you to render your UI in a magic way? If so, let us know in the comments below!
