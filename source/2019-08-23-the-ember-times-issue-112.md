## [Ember Octane Is Coming 🏎🐹](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/08/15/octane-release-plan.html)


The time has come: [Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/) is coming to your Ember application very soon!
As [recently announced in the official Ember Octane release plan](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/08/15/octane-release-plan.html), the very first edition of Ember is going to be released at the same time as the planned release date of Ember v3.14.

But what does it mean? By the time Ember 3.14 is published, the framework will include all Octane related features and these will be enabled by default, too. Additionally, the "Octane way" will be the primary and recommended way to build Ember apps. This will also be reflected in Ember's official documentation, like the API Docs or the Guides, and migration tools.

Wanna learn more about what is going to happen between now and the time Ember Octane lands? Looking for support on migrating and testing your apps with the Octane feature set? Be sure to give the [official release plan a read](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/08/15/octane-release-plan.html) and **get ready for Octane**!

## [Watch Talks from 1st Chennai EmberJS Meetup 🇮🇳](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh_rF0Qob_sx79YDqa4945EbOuly3AXX1)

On August 3, Chennai EmberJS featured 6 speakers at their inaugural Meetup: [@gokatz](https://github.com/gokatz), [@g13n](https://github.com/g13n), [@kandhavivekraj](https://github.com/kandhavivekraj), [@astronomersiva](https://github.com/astronomersiva), [@pranith024](https://twitter.com/pranith024), and [@rajasegar](https://github.com/rajasegar)! They covered various topics, including Ember Octane, tuning web performance, accessibility, differential bundling, JAM stack, and how ASTs (abstract syntax trees) fuel codemods and help us [auto-document Ember components](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-docgen). 💖
