## [Blog post: Connecting an Ember app to an OAuth2 Python Flask server 🔐](https://blog.softwarebyrichard.com/2020/05/26/connecting-an-ember-app-to-oauth2-python-flask-server/)

[Richard Bezemer (@rbezemer)](https://github.com/rbezemer) wrote a [couple](https://blog.softwarebyrichard.com/2020/05/19/using-oauth2-with-flask-rest-jsonapi/) of [blog posts](https://blog.softwarebyrichard.com/2020/05/26/connecting-an-ember-app-to-oauth2-python-flask-server/) on adding Oauth2 support to a basic web project using Flask and Ember.

The blog post goes through adding a custom authenticator (called `custom-oauth2` in our example), using the `ember g` command to tell [ember-simple-auth](https://ember-simple-auth.com/) how to connect and authenticate with our authentication server.

```sh
ember g authenticator custom-oauth2
```

It also discusses custom data such as `serverTokenEndpoint`, `clientId`, and `serverTokenRevocationEndpoint` which our custom authenticator can use to implement its `authenticate()` method.

Now we can use [ember-simple-auth](https://ember-simple-auth.com/) as a session management tool to handle querying for the current state of the user through the `session` Ember Service it provides.

```js
this.session.authenticate(
  'authenticator:custom-oauth2', 'password', this.username, this.password
);
```

Read more on the full the blog posts on [using Oauth2 with Flask-REST-JSONAPI](https://blog.softwarebyrichard.com/2020/05/19/using-oauth2-with-flask-rest-jsonapi/) and on [connecting your Ember app to that Flask server](https://blog.softwarebyrichard.com/2020/05/26/connecting-an-ember-app-to-oauth2-python-flask-server/)!
