## [Release 4.0.0 of ember-a11y-testing 🎉](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

[Steve Calvert (@scalvert)](https://github.com/scalvert) released 4.0.0 of [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing) which included changes to the API to make it hands off in terms of running accessibility audits. The `ember-a11y-testing` library is a wrapper around [Deque Labs'](https://github.com/dequelabs) [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility testing engine. It integrates into your testing environment using either a one-time setup, or in individual tests using an `a11yAudit()` test helper.

With the new 4.0.0 release, you can do audit of your code using the regular test helper APIs by importing the [`setupGlobalA11yHooks` function](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing#setupglobala11yhooks-usage) and invoking it in `tests/test-helper.js`. The `setupGlobalA11yHooks` function lets you write your own strategy on when to invoke the audit using the `shouldAudit` argument so you can run it all the time, for all the configured helpers, every n tests, for specific modules or test names, by route, etc.

Read more about the new changes to [ember-a11y-testing on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing#setupglobala11yhooks-usage)!
