## [Investigate component arguments with the new Ember Inspector 🕵️‍♀️](https://twitter.com/chancancode/status/1258514680256987136)

The brand-new, 4.0 version of [Ember Inspector](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/ember-inspector/) - the best tool for **inspecting and debugging your Ember applications** - is out! The recent release comes not only with lots of valuable bug fixes, but also with many amazing features, including:

- inspection of **component arguments**: You can now see and investigate [arguments](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0311-angle-bracket-invocation.html#arguments) passed to your components through Ember Inspector's component tree 🌳
- inspection of **the store**: Directly inspect your data store and send it as a variable for further debugging to your console. You can check out a demo recording of this feature in the [PR description](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1163) of [Sarah Yu's (@SYU15)](https://github.com/SYU15) work 🏬
- navigate through the component tree via **keyboard** with a new [accessibility improvement](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1153) 🎹

Check out the full list of features and improvements over at the project's [changelog](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/blob/v4.0.1/CHANGELOG.md#v400-2020-05-06).
