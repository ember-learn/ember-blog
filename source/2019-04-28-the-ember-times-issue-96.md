At the heart of open source are developers like you: people of all backgrounds, interests, and experience levels. Reminiscent of the Contributors Workshop at EmberConf BonusConf, Ember.js Paris held their own Contributors Workshop last week! Folks learned how to contribute to Ember, met other developers who shape our favorite framework such as [@Turbo87](https://github.com/turbo87) and [@locks](https://github.com/locks) from Ember Core, and made some pull requests!

<add more folks and examples of some of the PR's?>
