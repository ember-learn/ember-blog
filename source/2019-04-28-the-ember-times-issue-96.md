## [Merci for Your Contributions at EmberJS Paris 🐹🇫🇷](https://twitter.com/EmberJSParis/status/1120760348485799939)

Last week's **contributor workshop** organised by the folks over at the [EmberJS Paris meetup](https://twitter.com/EmberJSParis) has been a **real success**: with new changes to Ember CLI, improvements to Ember addons and even a brand-new RFC written, the Ember community gave back to the project, with some of the work even being made by first-time contributors! 🙌

Already feeling inspired to participate in or initiate your own **Ember contributor workshop**? Be sure to check out [these helpful resources to help you get you started](https://github.com/ember-learn/emberjs-contributors-workshop). And don't forget to check back on [\#dev-ember-learning Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs) and the [Ember Help Wanted app](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/) to find a something neat to work on. Codage heurex! 💻❤️

## [A New Milestone 💎 for Managing Concurrency in Your Test Suite 🕗](https://salsify.github.io/milestones/)

Managing **concurrency** in your app can be hard (at least until you start using [ember-concurrency](http://ember-concurrency.com) ✨).
But **managing concurrent behaviour** in your **tests** can be even harder.

But there's a new hope, called [Milestones](https://twitter.com/__dfreeman/status/1120410100227878913). Celebrating its first public release, this library helps you to build apps with concurrent behaviour that's easy to navigate in both your dev and test environment. Check it out [today and give it a try](https://salsify.github.io/milestones/)!
