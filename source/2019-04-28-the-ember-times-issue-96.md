## [Season 2, "May I Ask a Question" Begins! 🙋](https://jenweber.netlify.com/ember.js-stack-overflow-livestreams-return/)

[Jen Weber](https://github.com/jenweber) and [Chris Manson](https://github.com/mansona) kicked off the month of May with a new season of [May I Ask a Question](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyErLHzPqLAkL1F-SivFDcA).

Each week, the two will discuss and solve [Ember-related questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js?sort=newest&pageSize=15)—show us how we can answer community questions in an **effective and encouraging** way. 💞

To find out when the next live episode will air, please follow [@jwwweber](https://twitter.com/jwwweber) and [@real_ate](https://twitter.com/real_ate) on Twitter. Please read [Jen Weber's blog post](https://jenweber.netlify.com/ember.js-stack-overflow-livestreams-return/) to learn more about their initiative!

## [Merci for Your Contributions at EmberJS Paris 🐹🇫🇷](https://twitter.com/EmberJSParis/status/1120760348485799939)

Last week's **contributor workshop**, organised by the folks over at the [EmberJS Paris meetup](https://twitter.com/EmberJSParis), was a **real success**: with new changes to Ember CLI, improvements to Ember addons and even a brand-new RFC written, the Ember community gave back to the project, with some of the work even being made by first-time contributors! 🙌

Already feeling inspired to participate in or initiate your own **Ember contributor workshop**? Be sure to check out [these helpful resources to get you started](https://github.com/ember-learn/emberjs-contributors-workshop). And don't forget to check back on [#dev-ember-learning Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs) and the [Ember Help Wanted app](https://help-wanted.emberjs.com/) to find something neat to work on. Codage heureux! 💻❤️

## [A New Milestone 💎 for Managing Concurrency in Your Test Suite 🕗](https://salsify.github.io/milestones/)

Managing **concurrency in your app** can be hard (at least, until you start using [ember-concurrency](http://ember-concurrency.com) ✨). Managing **concurrency in your tests** can be even harder.

But there's a new hope, called [Milestones](https://twitter.com/__dfreeman/status/1120410100227878913). Celebrating its first public release, this library helps you build apps with concurrent behaviour that's easy to navigate in both your dev and test environment. Check it out [today and give it a try](https://salsify.github.io/milestones/)!

## [Edward Faulkner on Embroider, Ember CLI's Modern Build System 🎙️](https://embermap.com/podcast/edward-faulkner-on-embroider-ember-cli-s-modern-build-system)

At [EmberConf 2019](https://youtu.be/zYwdBcmz6VI?t=2855), we got a surprise announcement of [Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider), the **next-gen build pipeline for Ember applications**. 🧡

[EmberMap sat down with Edward Faulkner](https://embermap.com/podcast/edward-faulkner-on-embroider-ember-cli-s-modern-build-system), the creator of Embroider, to provide us more information.

Some key messages are:

- Embroider embraces ES modules and pull-based builds. It includes **only the code that your app needs.** 💯
- You can [try out Embroider today](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider#how-to-try-it)! Once you are able to build your app with the default settings, you can [look at various options](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider#options) to **boost performance** and **allow route splitting**. 🖖
- If you are an addon developer, please work towards [getting to the V2 format](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/blob/master/SPEC.md). This will allow Embroider to skip the expensive 1st build stage for your addon. ⏭️

Be sure to look out for an RFC to make Embroider the next build system for Ember. In the meantime, please check out [EmberMap's interview with Edward Faulkner](https://embermap.com/podcast/edward-faulkner-on-embroider-ember-cli-s-modern-build-system)!

## [Building with Octane, by Beto Cantú 🔥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkWs18V9dA)

At the inaugural [Ember San Antonio Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/EmberSA), Beto Cantú ([@betocantu93](https://github.com/betocantu93)) presented [an e-commerce app that he had built](https://github.com/betocantu93/octane-ecommerce) with [Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) (in just hours!).

In addition to new features such as `@tracked` and `{{on}}` modifier, Beto covered the fundamentals of Ember—from designing routes to deploying our app. This made a great introduction to attendees who had never used Ember before. 🤗

Please watch Beto's talk to [learn more about building apps with Octane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnkWs18V9dA). Don't forget to upvote and share it with your friends!

## [Decorators Arrive in Ember 3.10 & Octane ✨](https://www.pzuraq.com/ember-octane-update-landing-decorators/)

It's official: **Decorators** will be shipped with Ember 3.10 and Octane! 🎉

In [his latest coverage of Octane](https://www.pzuraq.com/ember-octane-update-landing-decorators/), [Chris Garrett](https://github.com/pzuraq) explains which decorators Ember supports, why others from [ember-decorators](https://github.com/ember-decorators/ember-decorators) addon weren't included, and how [we can use a polyfill to start using decorators now](https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-decorators-polyfill).

Please look forward to the launches of Ember 3.10 and Octane. [Learn more about decorators today!](https://www.pzuraq.com/ember-octane-update-landing-decorators/)

P.S. Send your congratulations to Chris on his wedding and honeymoon! 💐
