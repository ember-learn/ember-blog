## [Get together at EmberConf meetups 🍦🎲🗻](https://emberconf.com/#/schedule/meetups)

Besides learning a lot from the talks at [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/), it is also an amazing place to meet people and get to know them. One of the easiest places to do that is at the meetups that can be organised by **you**. 

Last year there were a lot of [different meetups](https://2019.emberconf.com/meetups.html), from delicious food and drink gatherings, to a nerve-racking chess tournament, and bouldering. 

If you have a great idea for a meet-up, you can [sign up here](https://emberconf.com/#/schedule/meetups). Keep an eye on this page as well if you want to know about all the meet-ups and when they will happen.
