## [Promises and UI states in Ember.js 🔄](https://embersteps.com/promises-and-ui-states-in-ember-js/)

[@herzzanu](https://github.com/herzzanu) wrote a [blog post](https://embersteps.com/promises-and-ui-states-in-ember-js/) on handling promises and UI states with Ember. Examples of this range from providing loading states when sending a post request to enabling complicated behaviour such as a backoff period before being able to interact with the UI again.

The idea was to write promise-based operations as [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) using the provided [ember-concurrency](http://ember-concurrency.com) APIs.

## [The Evolution of Ember.js at Intercom 📖](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoCxHTxpmSQ)

At [JSDayIE 2019](https://www.jsday.org/), [Gavin Joyce (@GavinJoyce)](https://github.com/GavinJoyce) presented a talk on how the adoption of Ember has helped [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) grow over the years since 2014.

In particular, Gavin attributed these four keys to success:

- Shared core values with Ember
- Ability to empower new devs to ship soon meaningful features
- Confidence in upgrades thanks to Ember's stability without stagnation
- Ember's commitment to continuous improvement (case study in rendering engine)

He closed the talk by giving a preview of [Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane)'s native JS approach: "I don't know what you would remove from that. [...] Everything has a purpose, and it's beautifully minimal and clean." 💙

Please [have a look at Gavin's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoCxHTxpmSQ) and share it with family and friends!
