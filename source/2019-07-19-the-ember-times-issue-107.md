## [RFC: Major Version Release for All Deprecation Removal üìã](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/512)

An RFC was proposed by [@kerrick](https://github.com/Kerrick) to have a major version release for all deprecation removals. The main issue revolves around the [Intimate API](https://twitter.com/wycats/status/918644693759488005) policy which can catch some developers off guard when upgrading Ember versions.

Certain private APIs are considered "Intimate API" because there are addons and consumers who use them despite being private. We sometimes have issues when deprecating these private APIs. This is because not all private APIs would warrant a deprecation warning (and therefore a major version change). The RFC proposes to have a major version release for all deprecation removals.

Read, comment, and discuss the [full RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/512)!

## [Ember 3.11 is Out üöÄ](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/07/15/ember-3-11-released.html)

A lot of **cool new features** have been released as part of Ember 3.11. With Ember.js 3.11 you now have access to features like the `on` modifier, the `fn` helper and much more. With 3.11 there's also a deprecation of `Function.prototype.observes`.

Furthermore, Ember Data 3.11 contains the [much awaited `Packages feature`](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0395-ember-data-packages.html) which allows you to use a new import syntax.

If you decide to upgrade then please have a look at [the release post](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/07/15/ember-3-11-released.html) since Ember Data 3.11 **currently contains a known bug** with the `model` blueprint.

## [Custom Configuration of Ember Auto Import for Your Project ‚è¨](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/tree/v1.3.0#customizing-build-behavior)

[Ember Auto Import](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-auto-import), a very useful addon, helps you easily **import** and use third-party JavaScript libraries from **npm** in your Ember app.

You can [configure the addon to fit your project's specific needs](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#customizing-build-behavior). By providing the `autoImport` configuration object in your app options defined in `ember-cli-build.js`, you can, for example, change the name of the packages to import from or exclude packages to be imported with Ember Auto Import, which you might have already provided to your app in another way.

If you're already an avid user of Ember Auto Import (or plan to become one), be aware that from version 1.4.0+ the addon will **no longer include** Webpack's polyfills for a set of Node.js globals and modules automatically.

[When upgrading to a version of the addon beyond 1.4.0](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import#i-upgraded-my-ember-auto-import-version-and-now-things-dont-import-what-changed), you might see errors such as `global is not defined` in your app or test suite. This might indicate that some of your packages‚Äîeven though they run in a browser environment‚Äîstill rely on globals (these are usually only available in a Node environment) and may require a polyfill to work correctly. You can check [this issue on the Ember Auto Import repo](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/218) for more context.


If you want to opt-in to these Node polyfills using Ember Auto Import, you can [configure them accordingly](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import/issues/224#issuecomment-503400386) via the `autoImport` options in your `ember-cli-build.js`:

```
// ember-cli-build.js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  autoImport: {
    webpack: {
      node: {
        Buffer: false,
        global: true,
        process: true,
      },
    }
  }
});
```

You can review the configuration defaults for the Node.js polyfill over at [the documentation for Webpack itself](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/#node).

## [Making an Electron App with Ember JS üñ•Ô∏è](https://dev.to/mitchartemis/making-an-electron-app-with-ember-js-part-1-initial-setup-11c0)

[Ember Electron](https://ember-electron.js.org/) is an addon that helps you create **ambitious cross-platform desktop apps**. Currently, its documentation resides in [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-electron/tree/master/docs).

To help you understand how to use the addon‚Äîin particular, **how to configure the addon for Mac, Linux, and Windows**‚Äî[@mitchartemis](https://dev.to/mitchartemis) published 2 blog posts, with a few more to come. üéâ

We encourage you to [read them today](https://dev.to/mitchartemis/making-an-electron-app-with-ember-js-part-1-initial-setup-11c0)! You can also find Mitch's [demo app and configuration files on GitHub](https://github.com/snipline/shopper).
