## [Organising the Organisers](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html)
The Ember Team has published a new blog post outlining some **structural changes** to the **Core teams**. It contains two changes: A new Steering Committee and a renaming of some of the existing teams.

The Steering Committee will be responsible for areas like community guidelines, managing Ember‚Äôs brand, dealing with legal questions and much more.

The renaming of the **Ember teams** means that moving forward, all the official teams will be known as Core teams: Ember.js Core, Ember CLI Core, Ember Data Core, and Ember Learning Core.

The intent here is to make it clear that all members of the teams are peers.

You can read all about the changes in the [Ember blog post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/06/30/organizing-our-contributors.html).

## [Twiddle Your Thumbs No More](https://ember-twiddle.com/)

[Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/) support for the latest (v3.2.2) release of Ember and Ember Data is here! With the great efforts of [@Gaurav0](https://github.com/Gaurav0), [@rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue) and [@gokatz](https://github.com/gokatz) you can now use the latest and greatest in Ember Land in your favorite browser Ember environment.

Some cool updates are **new keyboard shortcuts** for `run now` and `save` as well as a shortcut for quickly commenting JavaScript code.
There are also some updates to the contribution guide and of course it now supports Ember 3.0 - 3.2 out of the box!

Ember Twiddle, currently at `v0.15.0` is a great tool that allows creating simple Ember apps to showcase ideas, bugs, issues, demos and more. It allows using addons with the included `twiddle.json` and has a built-in generator just like Ember-CLI. There are even different keyboard layouts such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime and more.

Now is a great time to check out this amazing tool!

## [Upgrade ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Your App up to 11 with Ember 3.2 üêπ](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/02/ember-3-2-released.html)

The time has come. The long awaited [version 3.2 release of Ember, Ember CLI and Ember Data](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/02/ember-3-2-released.html) is out in the wild!

A little later than previously planned, this release makes up for the waiting with neat new features,
including the handy [let helper for on the spot creation of bindings in your templates](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0286-block-let-template-helper.html) or
the ‚ú® testing assertion library [qunit-dom](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom)
which is now added to your v3.2+ app on your very first `ember new`.

Ember Data's latest release
[removes](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2018/07/02/ember-3-2-released.html#toc_ember-data-feature-flag-removal-2-of-4) several **stale feature flags** -
put into place to allow users an opt-in to experimental features which have now become outdated
to make way for more recent developments of the addon.
If you're relying on any of these features in your app, be sure to
**reach out** to the Ember Data team for support with the transition [by opening an issue here](https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues).

You can also check out the release blog post's **Deprecations** sections to ensure that you're app is prepared for the
next major release. Read all about üëÄ it on the Ember Blog:

Now that the Guides and Deprecations have been moved into Ember apps, [emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com/) needs to be moved to an Ember app too! [Chris Manson](https://github.com/mansona) and [Melanie Sumner](https://github.com/MelSumner) recorded their **latest pairing session**, where they are working on **adding the beta** [ember-learn/ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide) to the new [ember-learn/ember-website](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website) (a rewrite of [emberjs/website](https://github.com/emberjs/website) in Ember, so as to make it easier to contribute to).
