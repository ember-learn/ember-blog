## [Decorators in FCP ü§ì](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/408)
<!-- alex ignore period -->
The [decorators Request for Comments (RFC)](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/rfcs/blob/decorators/text/0000-decorators.md) has been moved into **Final Comment Period (FCP)**. This means that if you have thoughts about decorators now is your chance to add your comment.

The motivation for the decorators RFC is that native decorators bring a **more natural way of declaring computed properties** to native classes than the current computed macros.

As always, feel free to read the [RFC](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/rfcs/blob/decorators/text/0000-decorators.md) and share your thoughts as a comment.

## [State of Ember Video üì∫](https://youtu.be/rPxOhSu-VOk)

[@knownasilya](https://github.com/knownasilya) published a video that summarizes the [State of Ember](https://youtu.be/rPxOhSu-VOk) today. In his video, he highlights key themes that represent where Ember is at today for people who are not following too closely to developments or those who are new to Ember.

[Ember Editions](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/9c7fe3f4e947b5f79050214334a98673494c25d7/text/0000-editions.md) represents how Ember gets packaged to provide a coherent story. Editions provide a way to market new features to the community since Ember historically has used major releases to deprecate API.

[Ember Octane](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/26c4d83fb66568e1087a05818fb39a307ebf8da8/text/0000-roadmap-2018.md#ember-octane) is a **new edition** that brings a good amount of features from new layout for projects, Glimmer components, Angle bracket component syntax, updates to the Guides to show the new programming model, a new website, a shift to move to decorators and more! Some of these have already landed and can be used today, while others are still in progress. Check out what‚Äôs coming in the [Octane tracking issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17234).

[Ember CLI Create](https://github.com/gossi/ember-cli-create) is a tool that - similar to `ember new` - allows to create Ember apps and with an option to create Octane apps, too! However since not everything about Octane has been settled, such as [module unification](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16373), you may need to refactor this code later on.

Check out the full video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/rPxOhSu-VOk)!
