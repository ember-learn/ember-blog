## [Release of EmberJS 3.19! 🎉](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html)

The Ember project is releasing version 3.19 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. This release kicks off the 3.20 beta cycle for all sub-projects. There are no new features or deprecations [introduced in Ember 3.19](https://blog.emberjs.com/2020/06/26/ember-3-19-released.html).

As a refresher the [Ember Release Cycle](https://blog.emberjs.com/2013/09/06/new-ember-release-process.html) follows the following:

- Every six weeks: A new stable version of Ember.js
- Every week: A new beta of the next version of Ember.js
- Every day: A new canary build, which is the last successful build of the day
- Every successful build: The ember-latest.js build is updated

To help test beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time use the [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon to continuously test your projects against the latest releases.

## [Rock & Roll with Ember.js Octane edition is here 🔥🐹](https://twitter.com/baaz/status/1276104785079472130)

There's an updated version of [Balint Erdi's (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi) excellent book Rock & Roll with Ember.js available, now with coverage for Ember's Octane Edition! 🎉

If you have not had a chance to give Rock & Roll with Ember.js a read, you should. This is one of the most well-written books on Ember.js. It's a great way to introduce people new to Ember to the framework's conventions and teach them how to write idiomatic Ember code. 

Using a pragmatic approach of learning by building, Rock & Roll with Ember.js takes the reader through the process of building an Ember application from the ground up. Readers should expect to finish the book with a solid understanding of the fundamentals involved in building Ember applications.

You can find the book [here](https://www.balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/).
