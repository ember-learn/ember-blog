## [Release 4.0.0 of ember-a11y-testing üéâ](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

[Steve Calvert (@scalvert)](https://github.com/scalvert) released 4.0.0 of [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing) which included changes to the API to make it hands off in terms of running accessibility audits. The `ember-a11y-testing` library is a wrapper around [Deque Labs'](https://github.com/dequelabs) [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility testing engine. It integrates into your testing environment using either a one-time setup, or in individual tests using an `a11yAudit()` test helper.

With the new 4.0.0 release, you can do audit of your code using the regular test helper APIs by importing the [`setupGlobalA11yHooks` function](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing#setupglobala11yhooks-usage) and invoking it in `tests/test-helper.js`. The `setupGlobalA11yHooks` function lets you write your own strategy on when to invoke the audit using the `shouldAudit` argument so you can run it all the time, for all the configured helpers, every n tests, for specific modules or test names, by route, etc.

## [Two deprecation RFCs merged üôå](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs)

On November 6th, the Ember framework team met to discuss [RFC 673: Deprecate `tryInvoke`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/673) and [RFC 674: Deprecate transition methods of controller and route](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/674). The team decided to move both RFCs forward to the **Accepted stage**, which will allow the author and others to work on implementation.

We'd like to extend our thanks to [Bach Vo (@bachvo)](https://github.com/bachvo) and [Jeldrik Hanschke (@jelhan)](https://github.com/jelhan) for designing their RFCs and addressing the community's feedback. For more information, please visit the links to the RFCs above.

## [Release 2.0.x of ember-select-light üî¶](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-select-light/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

[Ava Wroten (@hergaiety)](https://www.wroten.me/) released 2.0.0 of [ember-select-light](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-select-light/). You will find that the addon has moved to the [ember-a11y org](https://github.com/ember-a11y) (join us on [Discord in #dev-ember-a11y](https://discord.com/invite/emberjs)) and is **Octane ready**.

<!--alex ignore simple-->
**ember-select-light is a simple and accessible `<select>` dropdown component** ‚ú®. With its API, you can pass in a flat or nested array of options, or yield out to your template code that handles options. The component pairs nicely with the latest [ember-component-patterns for Select Elements](https://emberjs-1.gitbook.io/ember-component-patterns/form-components/select-element).

The 2.0.0 release drops support for older versions of Node and Ember. At minimum, Node v10 LTS and Ember.js v3.16 LTS are suggested. It also introduces some breaking syntax changes (see the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-select-light/blob/main/UPGRADE.md)). Lastly, documentation has been updated.

## [ember-key-manager v1.0.0 ‚å®Ô∏è](https://github.com/IcarusWorks/ember-key-manager)

ember-key-manager is a service for un(binding) key up and down events. [Bryan Crotaz (@BryanCrotaz)](https://github.com/BryanCrotaz) submitted a PR that brought [IcarusWorks/ember-key-manager](https://github.com/IcarusWorks/ember-key-manager) up to v1.0.0! With the major release, ember-key-manager now fully supports Octane, including template modifiers that can hook key presses to run component code.
