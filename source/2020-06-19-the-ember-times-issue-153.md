## [RFC: Type Stability for Addons 💠](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/pull/1158)

[Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) proposed a set of guidelines and tooling recommendations for managing changes as addons adopt [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) throughout the Ember ecosystem, as part of the path to making TypeScript a first-class citizen in Ember as a whole.

In the [RFC](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/pull/1158), it proposes to align with [Ember’s SemVer and LTS commitments](https://emberjs.com/releases/) and design workflows to support that policy, so that consumers of Ember addons which publish types are insulated from breaking changes in TypeScript whenever possible. The RFC outlines what needs to happen when we encounter:

- Breaking changes to type definitions
- Non-breaking changes to type definitions
- Bug fixes to type definitions
- Dropping support for previously-supported versions

Read through the full [RFC on Type Stability for Addons](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/pull/1158) and leave some feedback!
