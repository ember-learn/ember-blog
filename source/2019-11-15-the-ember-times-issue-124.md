## [400 Releases on the Ember.js Repo 🎉](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js)

The [ember.js repo](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) hit 400 releases on GitHub this week! We’ve had over [770 contributors](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/graphs/contributors) between May 2011 to November 2019. A big thank you ❤️ to the numerous efforts of all all these community members!

## [RFC #549: Ember Dev for Other Platforms 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/549)

[Adam Baker (@bakerac4)](https://github.com/bakerac4) has proposed the need to better advertise Ember as a cross-platform solution: Use 1 framework to create web, mobile, *and* desktop apps! The possibility of marketing Ember as cross-platform exists already, thanks to projects like [Corber](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/ember) and [Glimmer Native](https://github.com/bakerac4/glimmer-native).

How can we market Ember as cross-platform and support developing for other platforms? Be sure to [share your ideas with everyone](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/549) today!

## [RFC #554: Deprecate `getWithDefault` 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/554)

[Chris Ng (@chrisng)](https://github.com/chrisrng) has proposed deprecating support for `getWithDefault`. This method, which has [existed since Ember 1.0](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/1.0/classes/Ember.Object/methods/getWithDefault?anchor=getWithDefault), is intended to help an Ember object return a default value.

The problem with `getWithDefault` lies in its behavior. It returns the default value *only* when the retrieved value of the property is `undefined`. Other falsey values, such as `null` or `''`, don't result in the default value. This behavior may or may not be what you intended.

To help you write code explicitly, TC39 has come up with the [nullish coalescing operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing), `??`, now in Stage 3 proposal. RFC 554 explains that it'd be better to rely on the native implementation.

What are your thoughts on deprecating `getWithDefault`? We encourage you to [read the RFC and participate](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/554) today!

## [Creating Runtime Assisted Codemods Using Telemetry Helpers 📡](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/)

Thanks to [Rajasegar Chandran (@rajasegar)](https://github.com/rajasegar) and [Ryan Mark (@tylerturdenpants)](https://github.com/tylerturdenpants), the [ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers) addon features a [detailed readme](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers#ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers) and [companion blog post](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/). 💞

Traditionally, Ember codemods have relied on **static code analysis** to help you (a codemod author) convert files from one version to the next. In contrast, telemetry-powered codemods can **run the app** to help you gather data on components, services, routes, controllers, etc.

To learn more about telemetry helpers, we encourage you to visit [Rajasegar's blog](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/). You can also check out [ember-native-class-codemod](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-native-class-codemod) and [ember-no-implicit-this-codemod](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-no-implicit-this-codemod) to learn how codemods use telemetry helpers today!

## [Octane Super Rentals Tutorial Part 2 🚀](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/10-part-2/)

[Godfrey Chan (@chancancode)](https://github.com/chancancode) and [Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi)](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi) further expanded the Super Rentals Tutorial for Ember Octane by releasing part 2 of the tutorial!

This **automatically generated** tutorial now [supports decorators](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc/pull/52) thanks to [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) who had a fix to replace all `@` symbols within code blocks with a placeholder, processes them, and then switches them back after processing.

## [Brand-New Product Release Powered by Ember: Apple TV 🍏📺](https://twitter.com/mehulkar/status/1190318959955857408)

**Plenty of companies** and acclaimed brands **bet on Ember** when building digital products for thousands or even millions of users. Heroku, Netflix, TED, Tilde, Intercom and BetterUp are a few examples of [well-known businesses](https://emberjs.com/ember-users) who have benefitted from using Ember for years.

Did you also know that Apple's web platform **Apple TV** is [built with Ember](https://twitter.com/mehulkar/status/1190318959955857408)? Apple TV is now based on a modern 3.12 Ember tech stack which evolved its way up from a 3.4 app earlier this year. Furthermore, the app is increasingly adopting all the latest and sparkliest ✨ from the [new Ember Octane programming model](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/), making it a great showcase for modern Ember apps in the wild!

Do you have any feedback? Feel free to reach out to [Mehul Kar (@mehulkar)](https://github.com/mehulkar) for any questions, suggestions or bug reports.

## [Accessibility-Focused Ember Bootstrap Release ✨](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1190740590377472001)

A few weeks ago, [Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig) and the folks at [kaliber5](https://github.com/kaliber5) released version 3.1.0 of the fantastic Ember addon [ember-bootstrap](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap). 

This version focuses on **improving accessibility** by using [ember-focus-trap](https://github.com/josemarluedke/ember-focus-trap) to implement focus trap for modals and keyboard navigation of dropdowns. It also adds [ember a11y tests](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing) to the test suite! 🔥🔥🔥

Many thanks to all those that contributed to this release and the accessiblity concerns addressed by it 😄, including [Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig), [Brad Overton (@techn1x)](https://github.com/Techn1x), [Ramiz Wachtler (@rwachtler)](https://github.com/rwachtler) and [Jeldrik Hanschke (@jelhan)](https://github.com/jelhan). 

You can find the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#310-2019-11-02).
