## [RFC #549: Ember Dev for Other Platforms 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/549)

[Adam Baker (@bakerac4)](https://github.com/bakerac4) has proposed the need to better advertise Ember as a cross-platform solution: Use 1 framework to create web, mobile, *and* desktop apps! The possibility of marketing Ember as cross-platform exists already, thanks to projects like [Corber](http://corber.io/pages/frameworks/ember) and [Glimmer Native](https://github.com/bakerac4/glimmer-native).

How can we market Ember as cross-platform and support developing for other platforms? Be sure to [share your ideas with everyone](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/549) today!

## [RFC #554: Deprecate `getWithDefault` 💬](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/554)

[Chris Ng (@chrisng)](https://github.com/chrisrng) has proposed deprecating support for `getWithDefault`. This method, which has [existed since Ember 1.0](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/1.0/classes/Ember.Object/methods/getWithDefault?anchor=getWithDefault), is intended to help an Ember object return a default value.

The problem with `getWithDefault` lies in its behavior. It returns the default value *only* when the retrieved value of the property is `undefined`. Other falsey values, such as `null` or `''`, don't result in the default value. This behavior may or may not be what you intended.

To help you write code explicitly, TC39 has come up with the [nullish coalescing operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing), `??`, now in Stage 3 proposal. RFC 554 explains that it'd be better to rely on the native implementation.

What are your thoughts on deprecating `getWithDefault`? We encourage you to [read the RFC and participate](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/554) today!

## [Creating Runtime Assisted Codemods Using Telemetry Helpers 📡](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/)

Thanks to [Rajasegar Chandran (@rajasegar)](https://github.com/rajasegar) and [Ryan Mark (@tylerturdenpants)](https://github.com/tylerturdenpants), the [ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers) addon features a [detailed readme](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers#ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers) and [companion blog post](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/). 💞

Traditionally, Ember codemods have relied on **static code analysis** to help you (a codemod author) convert files from one version to the next. In contrast, telemetry-powered codemods can **run the app** to help you gather data on components, services, routes, controllers, etc.

To learn more about telemetry helpers, we encourage you to visit [Rajasegar's blog](http://hangaroundtheweb.com/2019/10/creating-runtime-assisted-codemods-using-telemetry-helpers/). You can also check out [ember-native-class-codemod](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-native-class-codemod) and [ember-no-implicit-this-codemod](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-no-implicit-this-codemod) to learn how codemods use telemetry helpers today!
