## [Boolean Dreams Come True ☁️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/407)

Ever wanted to pass **boolean arguments** to your **components** _just_ like you would pass boolean attributes - like checked or readonly - to an HTML element?

This fresh [RFC (Request for Comments) discusses how this could become reality](https://github.com/hakubo/rfcs/blob/component-boolean-arguments/text/0000-component-boolean-arguments.md)!

Leave your thoughts on how boolean arguments could be implemented for Ember components in the comments [below the original proposal](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/407).

## [Ember 3.6 Released 🚀](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/12/13/ember-3-6-released.html)
Ember 3.6 is out and ready to use. This release contains the last step of the **Native Class Constructor Update RFC**.  This introduces native classes in Ember but with some caveats so remember to read the [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/12/13/ember-3-6-released.html#toc_new-features-2) carefully before refactoring your code base.

Ember 3.6 also contains the final stage of the **router service RFC** which includes some new methods that can improve the way you deal with routing. There’s also new deprecations and some small fixes in Ember CLI so be sure to check out the complete [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2018/12/13/ember-3-6-released.html).

## [Components Patterns in Ember Blog 📚🧐](https://twitter.com/TheMacsour/status/1072088269742112768)

[@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) published a blog post on [component patterns in Ember](https://medium.com/macsour/components-patterns-in-ember-js-5e6fc6eea28f). The article presents a collection of **component patterns** used in the Ember community for readers to better understand what kind of component pattern would best match their particular use case.

[@Exelord](https://github.com/Exelord) particularly outlines 4 types of components: **presentational, contextual, container, and composable (or higher-order component)** with code samples including references!

Read more about it the [blog post](https://medium.com/macsour/components-patterns-in-ember-js-5e6fc6eea28f)!
