## [Ember Testing Guide v1 📗](https://twitter.com/PoslinskiNet/status/1239503392386568192)

[Dawid Pośliński (@PoslinskiNet)](https://github.com/PoslinskiNet/) wrote about testing best practices and which addons to use in the newly released [Ember Testing Guide v1](https://selleo.com/ebook/ember). The testing guide goes through why we need tests to begin with. What benefits does testing give us and what gaps are still present.

Following that, the testing guide discusses best practices in how we architect our testing code. It also goes through how to use the right kind of test. Should the test be unit, integration, acceptance, visual regression, or even manual? These principles are the building blocks to constructing effective tests.

Finally the guide goes through all the best addons available today and how to use them in testing your application with examples from [qunit-dom](https://github.com/simplabs/qunit-dom), [ember-test-selectors](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors), [ember-cli-timecop](https://github.com/matteodepalo/ember-cli-timecop), [ember-a11y-testing](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-testing), [ember-percy](https://github.com/percy/ember-percy) and many more!

Check it out as a [free eBook](https://selleo.com/ebook/ember), on [GitHub](https://github.com/PoslinskiNet/ember-testing-guide), or as a [PDF](https://selleo.com/uploads/ebooks/ember/ember_testing_guide.pdf)!

## [CI with GitHub Actions for Ember Apps ✅](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2020/03/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-ember-apps/)

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment may be skills that you get to practice maybe once on a production app, depending on your job title. But the truth is, you can practice them (_ahem_) continuously at an early stage for any app, no matter who you are. 💗

You might then ask, where can I learn how to add CI to my Ember app? Are there cool things that I can do _because_ I have an Ember app?

In his [blog post](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2020/03/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-ember-apps/), [Isaac Lee (@ijlee2)](https://github.com/ijlee2/) shows **step-by-step how you can write a GitHub Actions workflow**. Thanks to Ember's addon ecosystem, you can:

- Cache dependencies (avoid `yarn/npm install`)
- Lint files and dependencies
- Run tests separately from linting
- Split tests and run in parallel
- Take Percy snapshots in parallel

If you wanted to solve these problems or needed a reference code, [look no further](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2020/03/17/ci-with-github-actions-for-ember-apps/)! Feedback is always welcome (you can DM `@ijlee2` on Discord).

## [Respect the Underscore 🙇](https://medium.com/@ritual_steven/respect-the-underscore-331fa23e1595)

[Steven Elberger (@StevenElberger)](https://github.com/StevenElberger)'s blog post, "[Respect the Underscore](https://medium.com/@ritual_steven/respect-the-underscore-331fa23e1595)," is a fantastic example of what you can practice as a developer: **Document your bug for posterity**, especially if it failed your app or test suite in a catastrophic manner.

Here are some questions that you and your team can address:

- When did you first notice the bug?
- Which features or upgrades were recently worked on?
- What did you think caused the bug?
- How did you eliminate some of the possibilities?
- What did you do to fix the bug?

Because Steven's writing excellently builds suspense, we won't dare spoil the twists and ending here. Instead, we encourage you to [check out the post](https://medium.com/@ritual_steven/respect-the-underscore-331fa23e1595)!
