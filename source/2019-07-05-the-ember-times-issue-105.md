## [RFC to Add `load` Hook to Route 🎣](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/510)

A new RFC has been created by [@michaelrkn](https://github.com/michaelrkn) to get feedback on the idea of **adding a `load` hook to the Route**. The motivation for this is that the term `model()` can be confusing "because it implies that only one piece of data will be fetched, and it uses the term `model` that is more typically associated with backend development".

Feel free to [read the RFC](https://github.com/michaelrkn/rfcs/blob/route-data/text/0000-route-data-loading.md) and share your thoughts in the comment section.

## [To Sync or Not to Sync: Observers 2.0 ⏱](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0494-async-observers.html)

In an effort to remove legacy code from Ember, promote better programming practices in apps and lay the foundation for clearer code paths, a [recently accepted RFC (Request for Comments)](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/494) proposes an important change to the **observer** APIs: the [`addObserver`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@ember%2Fobject%2Fobservers/addObserver), [`removeObserver`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@ember%2Fobject%2Fobservers/removeObserver) and the [`observer`](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/functions/@ember%2Fobject/observer) functions shall be configurable to operate either synchronously (the way observers always used to work in Ember apps since the pre-v1.0 days) or asynchronously.

In Ember apps today, observers will be called immediately after any of the properties they are tracking have changed. Async observers as proposed in the RFC would instead be scheduled for the next runloop.

The RFC highlights how we can use the `sync` option (a Boolean) to make our observers asynchronous, one by one. After the community has had sufficient time to migrate their code, the RFC argues that Ember would be able to deprecate synchronous observers.

Find out more about the how and why behind **async observers** by giving the [full proposal a read!](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0494-async-observers.html)

## [RFC to Support Populating Head Tag ⛑️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/506)

The `<head>` tag does more than setting the title and favicon of a page. It also plays an **integral role in SEO and unfurling links**. Currently, we can use the [ember-cli-head](https://github.com/ronco/ember-cli-head) addon to modify the `<head>` tag. 💛

In the RFC, [@rwwagner90](https://github.com/rwwagner90) proposed that Ember gives developers the ability to modify the tag, using a **route hook** or **service**.

What are your thoughts? Please [take a look at the RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/506) and share your ideas and use cases of `<head>` tag!

## [Ember Inspector Update](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector)

Ember Inspector recently dropped support for Ember versions < 3.4. This has freed us up to 
remove a lot of cruft that has existed for supporting older Ember versions, and start to clean 
up and modernize the code. We are continuing to design the features for the future and work
towards delivering the features we promised in the past.

[Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) is still not currently supported, but we are working closely with the framework team to
get the APIs we need to map components to DOM elements and enable us to show the arguments 
passed to the component, and manipulate them inline. This will allow Inspector users to debug component behavior even better.

We are always looking for more people to help out with the considerable efforts required to keep 
Ember Inspector running, so if you would be interested in helping out, please reach out in the
[`dev-ember-inspector` channel](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/486243207072710656) on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs), we would love to have you!
