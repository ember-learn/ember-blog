## [RFCs around EmberObject Base Class üí°](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) opened 2 new RFCs around using the `EmberObject` **base class**.

The [@classic Decorator RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/468) adds a **set of warnings** for users who adopt **native class syntax** with `EmberObject` base classes. By using the `@classic` decorator, the warnings around edge cases such as `init` vs `constructor` or use of `Mixins` are turned off. These warnings are used as a guide for components to slowly migrate away from extending from `EmberObject` to more standalone such as `GlimmerComponent`.

The [Injection Hook Normalization RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/467) supersedes the submitted [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451). This RFC looks to answer **how** we should **handle dependency injection (DI)** when we are not extending from the `EmberObject` base class. It proposes to assign values during construction by normalising the assignment of the `owner`, access to injected properties, and follow the same conventions as other popular DI frameworks.

Read more about [@classic Decorator RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/468) and [Injection Hook Normalization RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/467) on GitHub!

## [Building a Hangman Game with Ember Octane](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) üé¨

<!--alex ignore hangman-hangwoman-->
Husband and wife team [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north) and [@lisaychuang](https://github.com/lisaychuang) did a [live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/400723351) on **how to build** a simple **hangman game**. They used the [Ember Octane preview](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) and the Glimmer components that come with it.

This video is a nice introduction into the world of **Ember Octane** and **Glimmer components** and definitely shows the benefits of doing pair programming. üòä

## [Record Data Errors RFC üìá](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465)

<!--alex ignore invalid-->
[@igorT](https://github.com/igorT) created a RFC to expose the content of **Invalid Errors** on Record Data. This RFC suggests **exposing** the **errors** provided by the server if it returns a `422`. `InvalidError` payload follows the JSON API error object spec, and if the error payload contains pointers those get mapped to attributes on a record.

For more information about the getter for the errors and the `RecordDataStoreWrapper` and an opportunity to give feedback, see the [Record Data Errors RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/465).

## [Episode 129 of the EmberWeekend Podcast üéô](https://emberweekend.com/episodes/empress-the-ember-press)

<!--alex ignore middleman-middlewoman-->
Episode 129 of the **EmberWeekend podcast** featured [@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) the creator of Authmaker. This episode included a range of topics including the **migration** of moving the **Ember Guides** from Middleman to be powered by Ember. Other areas include Middleman shortcomings and the rework of the Guides.

[@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) also talks about his journey using Broccoli Static JSON to **convert markdown** into **JSON API**. The ultimate goal was to use the Broccoli pipeline markdown to convert to JSON API and use static files!

[@mansona](https://github.com/mansona) also introduced **Guidemaker**:  A fully functional, static site implementation of a documentation site and EmberJS with fully out of the box SEO friendly output! With support to be hosted on S3 or any other site hosting solution. Check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) repo here.

## [Singleton Record Data RFC üíæ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/461)
Want to learn more about how some of Ember Data's APIs are developing? Take a peek at the Singleton Record Data RFC recently opened by [@runspired](https://github.com/runspired).

This RFC focuses on ensuring that Record Data can be implemented as a singleton, eliminates some redundant APIs and simplifies method signatures. This plan for Record Data offers opportunities for **performance optimizations** ‚ö°Ô∏è and **improved feature sets**! ‚ú®

For these proposed changes and a detailed design, including changes to many of the methods involved, check out the [Singleton Record Data RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/461).
