You might recall that we wrote about [@mansona](https://github.com/mansona)'s talk about [Empress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL66D0bR0RQ&feature=youtu.be&t=780), Ember's static site/JAMStack product, last week. Hopefully you'll be inspired to build your own empress-blog template even if you only know HTML and CSS. But wait, there's more! 

Empress now has a [Zoey mascot](https://emberjs.com/mascots) of its own, joining a fabulous crowd of Zoeys and Tomsters. Check out [Empress on GitHub](https://github.com/empress).
