## [RFC for @ember-data packages üì¶](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/395)

[@runspired](www.github.com/runspired) dropped a big RFC on [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) packages. The RFC proposes **public** import path changes for `ember-data` and moving `ember-data` into the `@ember-data` namespace.

<!--alex ignore nuts-->
The motivations for these changes revolve around improving the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) experience, reduce bike shedding, simplify the mental model, engage more contributors, improve CI time, and more! By breaking down the single large package into smaller consumable chunks, end users can pick and choose which parts they need and do not need as well as make the ecosystem easier to navigate.

There are [detailed designs](https://github.com/runspired/rfcs/blob/ember-data-packages-rfc/text/0000-ember-data-packages.md#detailed-design) on where each package will move towards so read more about it in the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/runspired/rfcs/blob/ember-data-packages-rfc/text/0000-ember-data-packages.md)!

## [With Learners in Mind: Improving the Ember Guides üêπ](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888)

This week a set of contributions to the [Ember Guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/) will make concepts like Ember Components, Ember Data among others much **easier to understand** for learners of the framework. The contributors [@zachgarwood](https://github.com/zachgarwood), [@ppcano](https://github.com/ppcano), [@LalithaRajanala](https://github.com/LalithaRajanala) and [@sduquej](https://github.com/sduquej) made sure that new concepts are introduced sufficiently and that instructions in the [Ember Tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/) are as clear as possible ([1](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/284), [2](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/283), [3](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/282), [4](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/280), [5](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/240), [6](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/222)). **Thank you** so much for **your contributions** to the Guides! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## [New and Improved Tutorial üó∫Ô∏è](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/)

One of the great ways to learn Ember is by building the `super-rentals` app by following the [tutorial in the guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/ember-cli/). One of the things you‚Äôll learn in that tutorial is how to integrate Google Maps into an Ember application. Sadly, some changes to Google Maps meant that now you would have to provide credit card information to embed it in your app.

Thankfully, **the amazing [@toddjordan](https://github.com/toddjordan)** has provided a great fix for this. He has switched the Google Maps part out of `super-rentals` and replaced it with the free alternative Leaflet Mapbox.

Thanks a lot for all of the hard work on this, [@toddjordan](https://github.com/toddjordan)! ‚ù§Ô∏è
