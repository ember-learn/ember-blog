هيلو Emberistas! 🐹

This week has been super busy with The Ember Times team reporting from **EmberConf 2019** in Portland Oregon! We are sharing highlights from the conference and news on **Ember Octane** with you 🐹⛽️

## [Greetings from EmberConf 2019](https://emberconf.com)

This week [EmberConf - the biggest, annual Ember conference](https://emberconf.com) - took place in Portland, Oregon, United States. Ember developers from all around the world came together to learn more about the newest features of the framework, best practices, case studies and most importantly meet online Ember friends.

Pictured are Jared Galanis, Melanie Sumner, Kenneth Larsen, L. Preston Sego III, Anne-Greeth Van Herwijnen as Zoey(!), Jessica Jordan, Jen Weber, Ryan Mark, Chris Ng, Amy Lam, and Ricardo "locks" Mendes. Not pictured: Robert Wagner, Alon Bukai, Edward Faulkner, Gaurav Munjal, Migeul Braga Gomes, and Sivakumar Kailasam for contributing to three or more issues in the past year! 💛

This year's [keynote by Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz](https://youtu.be/O3RKLHvpUAI?t=369) featured lots of insight into the **present and future of Ember** and the official announcement for the [**Edition Preview** of **Ember Octane**](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/). Wanna learn more about Ember Octane and the original RFC (Request for Comments)? Be sure to check out the [Ember Octane Edition website](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) and read all about it!

Also The Ember Times will notify you, as soon as the full recordings of the conference sessions are online, so be sure to **stay tuned** and if you haven't done so, [subscribe today](https://the-emberjs-times.ongoodbits.com/)!
