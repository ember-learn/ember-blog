## [Greetings from EmberConf 2019](https://emberconf.com)

This week [EmberConf - the biggest, annual Ember conference](https://emberconf.com) - took place in Portland, Oregon, United States. Ember developers from all around the world came together to learn more about the newest features of the framework, best practices, case studies and most importantly meet online Ember friends.

It's a five part series covering Native Classes and Decorators, Angle Brackets & Named Arguments, Tracked Properties, Element Modifiers and Glimmer Components, all broken out into separate blog posts.

## [Bind Helper RFC 💖💪](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/470)

Fresh off EmberConf, [@rtablada](https://github.com/rtablada) opened a new RFC that introduces a new helper `bind` to allow clear argument and context scope binding for functions passed in templates.

The idea is for the `bind` helper to take in a function and then the set of arguments that will be partially applied to the function, similar to the JavaScript bind method.

Check out the [full RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/470) on GitHub!

## [Power {{On}} your Ember App! 🔌](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/471)

A new RFC has been proposed by [@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) that proposes adding a new `{{on}}` modifier to Ember. This modifier will allow adding event listeners to elements in your templates.

You might be thinking, "Hey Ember Times Writer, we already have those! We have the `{{action}}` element modifier and `on*=` property bindings." However those have a [few downsides](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/27ee4012b0bbf63d4d304e6942b91ce37107bd91/text/0000-on-modifier.md#motivation) that are fixed with the `{{on}}` modifier.

The `{{on}}` modifier will explicitly add event listeners using the `addEventListener` API. It is based on the addon [ember-on-modifier](https://github.com/buschtoens/ember-on-modifier) by [@buschtoens](https://github.com/buschtoens).

An example: The following usages are equivalent:

```handlebars
<div {{on "click" this.handleClick passive=true}}></div>
```
```js
element.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick, { passive: true });
```

So get your modify on today and **make your voice heard** on the [open RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/471).
