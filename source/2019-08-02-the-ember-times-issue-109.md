## [Ember 2019-2020 Roadmap RFC 🐹](https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/1155909868907311110)

[@tomdale](https://github.com/tomdale) posted the first draft of the [Ember 2019-2020 Roadmap RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/519). This document is a distillation of multiple sources ranging from the blogs from the [Call For Blog Posts](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html), the [Community Survey](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/), discussions on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/emberjs2019), [Ember Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/), and more!

The high level goals for 2019-2020 are:
* Reducing the size and conceptual complexity of Ember.
* Improving ease of adoption.

This will be done by continuing to simplify Ember, modernizing our build system, enabling better accessibility (a11y) by default, and optimizing for growth by sharing how Ember Octane is modern, productive, and _fun_. 

Check out the [full RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/519)!
