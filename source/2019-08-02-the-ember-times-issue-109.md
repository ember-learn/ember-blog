## [Ember 2019-2020 Roadmap RFC 🐹](https://twitter.com/tomdale/status/1155909868907311110)

[@tomdale](https://github.com/tomdale) posted the first draft of the [Ember 2019-2020 Roadmap RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/519). This document is a distillation of multiple sources ranging from the blogs from the [Call For Blog Posts](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html), the [Community Survey](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/), discussions on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/emberjs2019), [Ember Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/), and more!

The **high level goals** for 2019-2020 are:

* Reducing the size and conceptual complexity of Ember.
* Improving ease of adoption.

This will be done by continuing to simplify Ember, modernizing our build system, enabling better accessibility (a11y) by default, and optimizing for growth by sharing how Ember Octane is modern, productive, and _fun_.

Check out the [full RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/519)!

## [Why Should I Not Use Observers in My Ember Application? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/why-should-i-not-use-observers-in-my-ember-application/16868/3)

In case you missed it on [Ember Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/), [@ef4](https://github.com/ef4) gave a [beginner-friendly, comprehensive answer](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/why-should-i-not-use-observers-in-my-ember-application/16868/3) to why we discourage the use of observers. (Thank you for asking, [@efx](https://github.com/efx)!)

As your application grows, a change to data can trigger your observers in unexpected ways. The chain of dependencies grows and can form a cycle — a circular dependency — without your knowing. Observer A calls observer B, which calls A again, which then... 😨

What we need is a **rule that we can enforce locally** to prevent cycles from forming at the global level. You've likely heard of this rule already: **Data Down, Action Up (DDAU)**. 💡

To learn more about exactly how DDAU prevents circular dependencies, we encourage you to [check out the answer on Ember Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/why-should-i-not-use-observers-in-my-ember-application/16868/3). If you have questions about Ember at any point, please feel free to ask them on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS), [Ember Discuss](https://discuss.emberjs.com/), and our very own [Readers' Questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqu7Lw_9cIkRtAiXKitgkAo4xX_pV1pdCfMJgIr6Py1V-9Og/viewform)!

## [Together we make EmberJS a better place ✏️](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/373)

We often feature awesome blogposts, intricate RFCs and helpful addons in the Times. But in such a large ecosystem and community, the **small things** also matter. [@backspace](https://github.com/backspace) and [@Imon-Haque](https://github.com/Imon-Haque) both contributed by just changing one file on the Ember website. [Fixing a typo](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/919) or a [broken link](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/373) that you stumble upon might seem really small, but it is valuable because it makes everyone's Ember experience better. So if you find something small, feel free to fix it by clicking the ✏️ on GitHub and creating a PR.

## [Super Rentals in Octane 🚀](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals/pull/127)

If you've been looking for an example of what an app written in **Ember Octane** looks like, look no further than the rewrite of the Super Rentals Tutorial that's been a part of the Ember.js guides for quite a while now.

The original rewrite PR was opened by [@vaidehijoshi](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi), author of the amazing ✨ [basecs](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/basecs-series) and [baseds](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/baseds-series) series. 

[@tomdale](https://github.com/tomdale) also followed up with contributions to get the Octane vesion of Super Rentals over the line.

The new Super Rentals tutorial will become a part of the guides when Ember Octane is released. For a sneak preview, you can check out the PR's [here](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals/pull/127) and [here](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals/pull/129).
