## [ember-template-lint v2 released ✅](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1231372429286608902)

In case you weren't aware, you can lint templates to follow Ember's recommended practices, avoid making common accessibility mistakes, and collaborate with your team more effectively. 💯

```bash
# Install (or upgrade to v2)
ember install ember-cli-template-lint

# Profit!
npm run lint:hbs
```

The v2 release was [recently announced](https://twitter.com/rwjblue/status/1231372429286608902). The most notable change may be that you can start following recommended rules for Ember Octane:

```javascript
// .template-lintrc.js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  extends: 'octane',
  rules: {
    /* Add custom rules here */
  }
};
```

You can find the full list of updates in the [changelog](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
