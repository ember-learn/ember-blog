### What It Does

The `ember-intl` addon is probably one of the most popular addons used in Ember apps today. As the go-to solution for bringing internationalisation to our application, it allows us to manage translations, date, time, number and currency formats in more than 150 languages!

### Why I Like It

The rich `ember-intl` service API and many useful template helpers help us to add new locales to our apps continually as our product's user base grows globally.

For those of us who have lots of languages to support in their application, `ember-intl` even allows us to load translations asynchronously - making sure that the size of the bundle that determines initial page load time stays small and neat!

Using `ember-intl` we can build Ember apps that are accessible beyond language barriers - making it more fun to share our app with friends all around the world!

[Check out ember-intl on Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-intl)! If you are a fan of multi-locale apps and you're using internationalisation addons yourself, let us know in the comments which ones are your favorite and the most fun to use!
