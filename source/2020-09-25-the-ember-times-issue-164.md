## [Become a writer for The Ember Times ‚úçÔ∏è](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-for-the-ember-times)

The Ember Times, the newsletter for [Ember Blog](https://blog.emberjs.com/), is maintained by an all-volunteer team.

Lately, the team has been busy with working on other Ember projects. To help everyone maintain a healthy work/life/open source balance, please consider **joining The Ember Times as a regular or guest writer**. We appreciate your help in any capacity. ü•∞

As writer, you will take on an active role in the Ember community and keep up with the latest events and discoveries. Prior experience in technical writing isn't required, as we will be happy to mentor and pair with you. We also encourage everyone around the globe to join; don't worry if English is your second language (or third, etc.).

Are you interested? You can reach out to the team in a few different ways:

- Chat on Discord in [#support-ember-times channel](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/485450546887786506)
- Leave a comment in the [ember-blog](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pulls) repo
- Tweet us [`@embertimes` on Twitter](https://twitter.com/embertimes)

We look forward to hear from you soon!

## [A new reference page for Ember CLI commands üîñ](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/cli-commands-reference/)

The Ember CLI Guides has a new webpage that lists [all Ember CLI commands](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/cli-commands-reference/). Please bookmark it for reference and onboarding new developers.

As you can imagine, the list of commands and command options grew over time so documenting it for the CLI Guides wasn't a trivial task. We'd like to recognize [Tim (@fozy81)](https://github.com/fozy81) for their amazing contribution. üíØ

As always, you can check commands and command options in your terminal by running `ember --help`. Please feel free to provide feedback for the new webpage. If you see incorrect or missing information, you can open an issue in the [cli-guides](https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides) repo.

## [EmberJS with REST API üí™](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/)

[John Costanzo (@jrock2004)](https://twitter.com/jrock2004) wrote a blog titled [EmberJS with REST API](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/). The blog explains how to get your APIs to work well with Ember Data out of the box, if it follows REST API conventions. If your APIs don't follow REST conventions, the post gives details about how to modify your Ember app serializer to make it work with Ember Data. 

The blog also discusses using [`keyForAttribute`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/JSONAPISerializer/methods/keyForAttribute?anchor=keyForAttribute) to make some of the manual work a little easier, so that you do not have to map each API property to the Ember model property. Head over to [the blog post](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/) today and give it a read.

## [ember-concurrency 2.0.0.beta-1 üéâ](https://twitter.com/m4xm4n/status/1308945677800681473)

There's a [new beta release](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1) of `ember-concurrency`! Thanks to the hard work of [Max Fierke (@maxfierke)](https://github.com/maxfierke) 2.0.0.beta-1 introduces `@tracked` on Ember 3.16+, removes the ability to directly use the `{{action}}` helper, and removes the `get` and `set` compatibility methods from `Task`, `TaskGroup`, and `TaskInstance`.

As Max mentions in his tweet, 2.x is largely compatible with 1.x. For users that maintain addons that depend on `ember-concurrency`, it would be very helpful if you can use a wider version range so that some folks can try the 2.x betas and others can upgrade when they're able to. 

More information about this and about upgrading to 2.0.0-beta.1 and other future 2.x releases in
general can be found in the [upgrade document](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/blob/v2/UPGRADING-2.x.md).

Go ahead and give the [release](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1) notes a read.

## [Blog Post: Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane ‚ú®](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/)

A new blog post from [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) talks about [Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/). This blog post is a continuation of [Migrating Off of PromiseProxyMixin in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/), which describes a way to divest mixin and inheritance in favor of composition. Chris does this by using a [load helper](https://gist.github.com/chriskrycho/306a82990dd82203073272e055df5cd1) and a new `AsyncData` structure.

The new blog goes through treating that `AsyncData` as ordinary data, but making sure to handle all states (loading, loaded, error). By integrating with tracked properties, the `AsyncData` class reacts to its modeled states and internals, handling this transition for us. This enables us to access the data returned from the load helper as normal data and react based on its state.

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { load } from 'my-app/helpers/load';
import { fetchSomeData } from 'my-app/data/fetchers';

export default class Neato extends Component {
  get data() {
    return load(fetchSomeData(this.args.userId));
  }

  get displayData() {
    switch (this.data.state) {
      case 'LOADING':
        return 'loading...';
      case 'LOADED':
        return this.data.value;
      case 'ERROR':
        return `Whoops! Something went wrong! ${this.data.error.message}`;
    }
  }
}
```

## [Autotracking Developer Experience üî•](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/autotracking-elegant-dx-via-cutting-edge-cs/)

If you couldn't get enough [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho), we have good news! üòÑ  Chris has released a follow-up blog post to the one referenced above. 

How does autotracking in Ember or Glimmer work? How does it improve developer experience? Which computer science concepts make it possible? (Answer: Lamport clocks ü§Ø)

If you're ready to learn a bit more about how efficient the autotracking system in Ember or Glimmer apps can be, you should head on over to the [post](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/autotracking-elegant-dx-via-cutting-edge-cs/). 

Rest assured, it's a pretty approachable explanation of some complex topics that we as Ember users benefit from in an Octane world. All are encouraged to go check it out!
