## [EmberJS with REST API üí™](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/)

[John Costanzo (@jrock2004)](https://twitter.com/jrock2004) wrote a blog titled [EmberJS with REST API](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/). The blog explains how to get your APIs to work well with Ember Data out of the box, if it follows REST API conventions. If your APIs don't follow REST conventions, the post gives details about how to modify your Ember app serializer to make it work with Ember Data. 

The blog also discusses using [`keyForAttribute`](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/JSONAPISerializer/methods/keyForAttribute?anchor=keyForAttribute) to make some of the manual work a little easier, so that you do not have to map each API property to the Ember model property. Head over to [the blog post](https://jcwebconcepts.net/emberjs-with-rest-api/) today and give it a read.

## [Readers' Question: Migrating off of mixins in Ember Octane üëã](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/)

<please include link to external article/repo/etc in paragraph / body text, not just header title above>

Greetings from Ember Times HQ! We had a **Readers' Question** come in: 

> What's the recommended alternative for `Ember.Mixin` in Octane?

In Classic Ember, if you wanted to define a piece of DOM behavior that you could reuse across your application, you would define a component `Mixin` that implemented the appropriate lifecycle hooks. As of Ember 3.15, the Ember project recommends Ember Octane for new applications and addons. And idiomatic Octane recommends that you avoid mixins. Going back to [Octane is Here](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html), [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)'s](https://github.com/wycats) gives a migration example. Element modifiers provide a new way to reuse DOM behavior, without some of the drawbacks that mixins have.

**Before (Classic Ember): Mixins**

```js
import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';

export default Mixin.create({
  didInsertElement() {
    this._super();
    activateTabs(this.element);
  }

  willDestroyElement() {
    this._super();
    deactivateTabs(this.element);
  }
})
```

And then you would use the `Mixin` in a component like this:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';

export default Component.extend(Tabs, {
  // ...
});
```

**After (Ember Octane): Element Modifiers**

This is what our `Tabs` mixin looks like when reimplemented as a modifier.

```js
import { modifier } from 'ember-modifier';

export default modifier(element => {
  activateTabs(element);

  return () => deactivateTabs(element);
});
```

Since element modifiers work on any element, you don't need to create a whole component to create reusable DOM behavior. You can use a modifier on any element with this element modifier syntax.

```hbs
<div {{tabs}}></div>
```

Continuing further on mixins, [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) recently blogged about [Migrating Off of PromiseProxyMixin in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/). A common pattern in many Classic Ember apps and addons was to use `PromiseProxyObject` mixin with `ObjectProxy` to expose the state of a promise to end users, and to make accessing the resolved data more convenient.

## [Blog Post: Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane ‚ú®](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/)

A new blog post from [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) talks about [Async Data and Autotracking in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/async-data-and-autotracking-in-ember-octane/). This blog post is a continuation of [Migrating Off of PromiseProxyMixin in Ember Octane](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/migrating-off-of-promiseproxymixin-in-ember-octane/), which describes a way to divest mixin and inheritance in favor of composition. Chris does this by using a [load helper](https://gist.github.com/chriskrycho/306a82990dd82203073272e055df5cd1) and a new `AsyncData` structure.

The new blog goes through treating that `AsyncData` as ordinary data, but making sure to handle all states (loading, loaded, error). By integrating with tracked properties, the `AsyncData` class reacts to its modeled states and internals, handling this transition for us. This enables us to access the data returned from the load helper as normal data and react based on its state.

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { load } from 'my-app/helpers/load';
import { fetchSomeData } from 'my-app/data/fetchers';

export default class Neato extends Component {
  get data() {
    return load(fetchSomeData(this.args.userId));
  }

  get displayData() {
    switch (this.data.state) {
      case 'LOADING':
        return 'loading...';
      case 'LOADED':
        return this.data.value;
      case 'ERROR':
        return `Whoops! Something went wrong! ${this.data.error.message}`;
    }
  }
}
```
