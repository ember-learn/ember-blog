## [Learn how to make your existing Ember app accessible 💪](https://simplabs.com/blog/2020/06/02/how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/)

Using Ember, you might be familiar with a set of tools that you can already use today to [make your app accessible](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/accessibility/). But what do you do if you are working on an already **mature Ember app** that needs a lot of improvements to **become accessible**? Where do you even start?

In her recent blog post, [Samanta de Barros (@sdebarros)](https://github.com/sdebarros) shares [her findings](https://simplabs.com/blog/2020/06/02/how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/) on improving the accessibility of an Ember app by employing an automated, gradual and **a11y-focussed testing strategy**, semantic markup and screen reader testing.

If you want to find out how to level up your app's accessibility, read [her blog post on the simplabs blog](https://simplabs.com/blog/2020/06/02/how-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-your-app/) and if you learned something from it, be sure to share it with your Ember friends, too!

## [Introducing ember-concurrency-async 🚀](https://github.com/chancancode/ember-concurrency-async)

Have you wanted to use [`ember-concurrency`](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency) with TypeScript, but run into some limitations? In case you were not aware, there's a new addon by [Godfrey Chan (@chancancode)](https://github.com/chancancode) called `ember-concurrency-async`. This addon introduces the familiar `async/await` syntax into `ember-concurrency` tasks. 😃

The main advantage of the async method syntax over the default `ember-concurrency` generator method syntax is that it works better with the TypeScript compiler and things powered by it, such as the JavaScript language server in Visual Studio Code. Due to the fact that TypeScript already understands the `await` keyword natively, the complier understands that yielding a value "returns" its resolved value - something not possible with generator method syntax.

Head on over to the [repo](https://github.com/chancancode/ember-concurrency-async) to learn more and take a look at some examples of how `ember-concurrency-async` can help you write `ember-concurrency` tasks in TypeScript.
