## [Octane Is Here üéâ](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html)

[Ember 3.15](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/ember-3-15-released.html) was released this week. In addition to the usual new features, improvements and bug fixes, this release also marks the official release of Ember's first edition - **Ember Octane**!

But what is Ember Octane? Ember Octane is the **new, recommended way** for developers **to build Ember applications** and **addons**.

<!--alex ignore easy-->
Octane features a new reactivity model, a renewed practice of building components and a stronger focus on HTML driven web development than ever before. It aims to make the development of performant Ember apps not only more easy and productive, but also **more fun** right from the start. And on top of that, Ember Octane is **fully opt-in** and **interoperable** for existing Ember apps - which means you can try out the new way of building modern Ember Octane apps gradually, without having to rewrite your entire app today.

Want to know all about Ember Octane? Learn more about what's new in Octane and how to get started [in the official Ember Octane release announcement](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html) by [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats)!

## [New ember-autofocus-modifier üí°](https://medium.com/qonto-engineering/autofocus-modifier-improving-our-component-apis-fd589b98f4e)

While building an autofocus feature for their components, Qonto engineers were also able to improve their APIs. [Cyrille David (@dcyriller)](https://github.com/dcyriller) and team wanted to add autofocus to several components across two apps. For example, both their one-time-password input and their email input component needed autofocus. Since mixins are no longer recommended in the Ember ecosystem, Cyrille went with modifiers. [And they blogged about their experience here!](https://medium.com/qonto-engineering/autofocus-modifier-improving-our-component-apis-fd589b98f4e)

Modifiers are a new feature in [the recently released Ember Octane edition](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/12/20/octane-is-here.html). They allow for **sharing code between components**, similar to directives in Vue or Angular. We revisited [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq)'s blog [Coming Soon in Ember Octane - Part 4: Modifiers](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/03/06/coming-soon-in-ember-octane-part-4.html) and the [new Octane Guides: Out-of-Component-Modifications](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-lifecycle-dom-and-modifiers/#toc_out-of-component-modifications) to learn more!

Qonto wrapped up the code in a small addon, [`ember-autofocus-modifier`](https://github.com/qonto/ember-autofocus-modifier). You can use the code as-is, or copy the [snippet code](https://github.com/qonto/ember-autofocus-modifier/blob/v0.0.1/addon/modifiers/autofocus.js) and experiment with creating your own modifier.

## [Three New RFCs to Add New Template Helpers 3Ô∏è‚É£](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Acibernox+templates)

[Miguel Camba @cibernox](https://github.com/cibernox) opened a slew of RFCs around adding new built-in operators to Ember templates. The idea comes from functionality provided in [ember-truth-helpers](https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers) and is a subset of his [other RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/388) to add basic helpers to Ember templates.

The three template helper RFCs Miguel proposed are the following:

- [Adding Equality Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/560) such as the `{{eq}}` and `{{neq}}` helpers
- [Adding Numeric Comparison Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/561), specifically the `{{lt}}` and `{{gt}}` helpers
- [Adding Logical Operators](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/562) which are the `{{and}}`, `{{or}}` and `{{not}}` helpers

Help get this off the ground by adding your input to these changes today!
