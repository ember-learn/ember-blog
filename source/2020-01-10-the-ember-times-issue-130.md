## [How to migrate to Octane 🐹🏗️](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/)

<!--alex ignore nuts-->
Ember Octane represents a big shift in Ember's syntax, features, and mental models. There is, however, no need for a stop-the-world migration, Octane provides an opt-in method of migration where you can apply each core feature enhancement incrementally.

If you are migrating an existing Ember application to Octane we have an excellent list of resources to help you out:

- [The Ember Guides: Octane Update Guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/)
- [The Ember Octane vs. Classic Ember Cheat Sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/)
- [Ember Atlas Recommended Migration Order](https://www.notion.so/Atlas-Recommended-Migration-Order-a22f948a7cce4e01896d674f727bee74)

Whatever you end up doing, you won’t have to do it alone as members of the community have generously contributed [numerous codemods](https://github.com/ember-codemods) to help us to migrate efficiently.

## [The Ember Atlas 🗺](https://www.notion.so/The-Ember-Atlas-4094f81c86c34badb4a562ed29414ae1)

The Ember Atlas is an unofficial resource for Ember curated by various people in the Ember Community. It includes best practices, upgrade guides and more! The Ember Atlas is built to be a Wiki for Ember for various content that isn't in the guides yet or won't ever make it in. 

To get started it is recommended to read the [Introduction](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-d11ec02706d74eab960b3e2b11494bc7) which explains what The Ember Atlas is.

Of particular interest today is the [Ember Octane Upgrade Guide](https://www.notion.so/Ember-Octane-b8ad64b7adf74218942fc69ead7b6892). This section includes information to help Ember developers upgrade from Classic apps/addons to Octane ones.

Some notable parts of the upgrade guide:
