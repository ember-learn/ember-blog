## [How to migrate to Octane 🐹🏗️](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/)

<!--alex ignore nuts-->
Ember Octane represents a big shift in Ember's syntax, features, and mental models. There is, however, no need for a stop-the-world migration, Octane provides an opt-in method of migration where you can apply each core feature enhancement incrementally.

If you are migrating an existing Ember application to Octane we have an excellent list of resources to help you out:

- [The Ember Guides: Octane Update Guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/)
- [The Ember Octane vs. Classic Ember Cheat Sheet](https://ember-learn.github.io/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/)
- [Ember Atlas Recommended Migration Order](https://www.notion.so/Atlas-Recommended-Migration-Order-a22f948a7cce4e01896d674f727bee74)

Whatever you end up doing, you won’t have to do it alone as members of the community have generously contributed [numerous codemods](https://github.com/ember-codemods) to help us to migrate efficiently.
