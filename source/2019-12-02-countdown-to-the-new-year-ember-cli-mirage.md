**This is the second in our December series–"Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons". We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 2

Today we are going to look at one of our community's most popular addons- [ember-cli-mirage](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-mirage).

### What It Does

The `ember-cli-mirage` addon is a client-side server to help you build, test, and demo your Ember app. It helps developers be more productive by providing ways to generate fake data, allowing front-end engineers to spend more time focusing on the UI. 

### Why I Like It

As I was informally polling the community about their favorite Ember addons, ember-cli-mirage came up A LOT. For good reason, too. It's well-supported by the addon maintainers, there's a dedicated [documentation site](https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/), and there's support on the [Ember Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/emberjs) in the #ec-mirage channel. 

> "It’s a part of the ecosystem I dearly miss when I work with other frameworks."

As an extra bonus, EmberMap has generously made their ["Mirage Tips and Tricks" video series](https://embermap.com/topics/mirage-tips-and-tricks) free to everyone (usually for subscribers only!) for December. Be sure to check it out! 

Do you use this addon? [Or one like it?](https://emberobserver.com/categories/mocking,-fixtures,-and-factories) We'd love to hear about the Ember addons that bring you joy!
