## [Yehuda's Octane Tutorial 🔥](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)

There's an awesome new Octane tutorial in town 🤠 and it's written by none other than our very own [Yehuda Katz @wycats](https://github.com/wycats)!!!

<!-- alex ignore just-->
In the tutorial you'll build the schedule page for a conference like EmberConf. It feels like just the right thing to build after our amazing virtual EmberConf 💙💚💛💜🧡. 

The first part in this tutorial, [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/), begins with something that not all JavaScript tutorials cover, HTML and CSS, using CSS Grid and Flex. You'll learn how to go from mocks to a deployed app in very little time.

The second part of the tutorial, [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/), is also out and it covers refactoring out some of the HTML duplication. It's a great introduction to how you can use components and lists to reduce repetition.

So far there are 7 posts planned:

- [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)
- [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/)
- Pulling Out Data
- Airtable Time
- Cleaning Things Up
- Adding More Pages
- Polishing: Server-Side Rendering, Prerendering and Code Splitting

So be on the look out 👀 for more in this very helpful new series!

## [Achieve consistent decorator positioning with a new eslint plugin ↕️](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/eslint-plugin-decorator-position)

Ever had to **put up with** inconsistent decorator positions in pull requests, because there wasn't a lint rule for that?
_Now_ there is! 🎉 [eslint-plugin-decorator-position](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/eslint-plugin-decorator-position)
provides some configuration with some recommended defaults to help your project achieve that last bit of consistency.

## [A quick tip for refactoring your templates 📑](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates)

[Abhilash L Ramesh @abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr)  wrote a small and clear [blog post](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates) with actionable tips to make your Ember Templates cleaner. So if you have complex `if-else`  logic in your template that you would like to make clearer, this blogpost could help you out. 

He also added some extra bonus tips, but no **spoilers** here, head to the [blog post](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates) to check them out!

## [Ember Autostash Modifier 💾](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1239325059656933376)

New modifier alert 🚨! [Preston Sego @NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) has created [`ember-autostash-modifier`](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-autostash-modifier) that stashes changes, binds those changes to a key, and restores those changes based on that key! 

This modifier is useful for chat apps, where you'd want to persist incomplete messages on a contact's page while the user navigates between other contacts before finishing and submitting a message, or where you want to bind component data based on the URL. Checkout this [demo](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-autostash-modifier/1) of the modifier in action.

It's so nice to see the eco-system of Ember modifiers continue to grow 😀, we can't wait to see what the awesome folks in the Ember community come up with next!

## [tracked-built-ins v1 released! 💯](https://twitter.com/pzuraq/status/1240069037364633600)

At his EmberConf talk, "[Autotracking: Reactivity and State in Modern Ember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBSU2HCLbU&list=PL4eq2DPpyBbkC03mdzlyej6tcbEqrZK8N)," [Chris Garrett (@pzuraq)](https://github.com/pzuraq) announced a new addon to help you track JavaScript's built-in classes.

With [tracked-built-ins](https://github.com/pzuraq/tracked-built-ins), your app can automatically react to changes in Objects, Arrays, Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, and WeakSets.

```javascript
import { tracked } from 'tracked-built-ins';

class Foo {
  @tracked value = 123;

  obj = tracked({});
  arr = tracked([]);
  map = tracked(Map);
  set = tracked(Set);
  weakMap = tracked(WeakMap);
  weakSet = tracked(WeakSet);
}
```

[Give it a try today](https://github.com/pzuraq/tracked-built-ins)! Your feedback will help improve autotracking in Ember. 💞

## [Blog post: ember-template-lint rule from addon ✅](https://mehulkar.com/blog/2020/03/ember-template-lint-rule-from-addon/)

[Mehul Kar (@mehulkar)](https://github.com/mehulkar) wrote a [blog post](https://mehulkar.com/blog/2020/03/ember-template-lint-rule-from-addon/) on how to ship and use an [Ember template lint](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint) rule from an addon.

First up, the [Plugin API](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint/blob/v2.4.1/docs/plugins.md) provides an overview on the `ember-template-lint` plugin system including where to add them or it can be the root of the repo as the blog shows. In order to test your template lint rule, the blog post outlines how to use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and configure it to run tests in the `node-tests` directory. Finally, in order to use the plugin in an app we would need to add the plugin and enable the lint rule in `.template-lintrc.js` (like the example below).

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['my-addon-name/template-lint-plugin'],
  rules: {
    'the-rule-name': true
  }
}
```

To follow the detailed steps please read the [full blog post](https://mehulkar.com/blog/2020/03/ember-template-lint-rule-from-addon/) and have a [powerful way to encourage a certain way of programing](https://twitter.com/mehulkar/status/1240020900960825345) today!
