## [Yehuda's Octane Tutorial 🔥](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)

There's an awesome new Octane tutorial in town 🤠 and it's written by none other than our very own [Yehuda Katz @wycats](https://github.com/wycats)!!!

<!-- alex ignore just-->
In the tutorial you'll build the schedule page for a conference like EmberConf. It feels like just the right thing to build after our amazing virtual EmberConf 💙💚💛💜🧡. 

The first part in this tutorial, [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/), begins with something that not all JavaScript tutorials cover, HTML and CSS, using CSS Grid and Flex. You'll learn how to go from mocks to a deployed app in very little time.

The second part of the tutorial, [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/), is also out and it covers refactoring out some of the HTML duplication. It's a great introduction to how you can use components and lists to reduce repetition.

So far there are 7 posts planned:

- [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)
- [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/)
- Pulling Out Data
- Airtable Time
- Cleaning Things Up
- Adding More Pages
- Polishing: Server-Side Rendering, Prerendering and Code Splitting

So be on the look out 👀 for more in this very helpful new series!

## [A quick tip for refactoring your templates 📑](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates)

[Abhilash L Ramesh @abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr)  wrote a small and clear [blog post](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates) with actionable tips to make your Ember Templates cleaner. So if you have complex `if-else`  logic in your template that you would like to make clearer, this blogpost could help you out. 

He also added some extra bonus tips, but no **spoilers** here, head to the [blog post](https://abhilashlr.in/ember-refactor-templates) to check them out!

## [Ember Autostash Modifier 💾](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1239325059656933376)

New modifier alert 🚨! [Preston Sego @NullVoxPopuli](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) has created [`ember-autostash-modifier`](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-autostash-modifier) that stashes changes, binds those changes to a key, and restores those changes based on that key! 

This modifier is useful for chat apps, where you'd want to persist incomplete messages on a contact's page while the user navigates between other contacts before finishing and submitting a message, or where you want to bind component data based on the URL. Checkout this [demo](https://nullvoxpopuli.github.io/ember-autostash-modifier/1) of the modifier in action.

It's so nice to see the eco-system of Ember modifiers continue to grow 😀, we can't wait to see what the awesome folks in the Ember community come up with next!
