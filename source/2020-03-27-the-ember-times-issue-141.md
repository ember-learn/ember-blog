## [Yehuda's Octane Tutorial 🔥](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)

There's an awesome new Octane tutorial in town 🤠 and it's written by none other than our very own [Yehuda Katz @wycats](https://github.com/wycats)!!!

<!-- alex ignore just-->
In the tutorial you'll build the schedule page for a conference like EmberConf. It feels like just the right thing to build after our amazing virtual EmberConf 💙💚💛💜🧡. 

The first part in this tutorial, [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/), begins with something that not all JavaScript tutorials cover, HTML and CSS, using CSS Grid and Flex. You'll learn how to go from mocks to a deployed app in very little time.

The second part of the tutorial, [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/), is also out and it covers refactoring out some of the HTML duplication. It's a great introduction to how you can use components and lists to reduce repetition.

So far there are 7 posts planned:

- [Let's Go](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/25/ember-octane-lets-go/)
- [Components](https://yehudakatz.com/2020/03/26/ember-octane-components/)
- Pulling Out Data
- Airtable Time
- Cleaning Things Up
- Adding More Pages
- Polishing: Server-Side Rendering, Prerendering and Code Splitting

So be on the look out 👀 for more in this very helpful new series!
