## [Check out ember-dayjs-helpers 🕰️](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-dayjs-helpers)

[Rajasegar Chandran (@rajasegar)](https://github.com/rajasegar) created the [ember-dayjs-helpers](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-dayjs-helpers) library which contains over 30+ template helpers based on [day.js](https://day.js.org/en), a fast 2kB alternative to Moment.js with the same modern API.

<!--alex ignore easy-->
In your templates, you can easily use day.js APIs using the provided helpers. For example, you can use the `{{day-js}}` helper to display the current date or format a date provided.

```hbs
{{day-js}} => Display today's date
{{day-js date='2019-01-25' format='DD-MM-YYYY'}} => 25-01-2019
{{day-js date='2019-01-25' format='DD MMMM YYYY'}} => 25 January 2019
```

Check out the full project with the list of helpers provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/rajasegar/ember-dayjs-helpers)!
