## [Just released: stable version of ember-bootstrap v4 💥](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1290710885070262275)

[Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig) announced the **stable release** of ember-bootstrap v4, [tweeting](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1290710885070262275) that it's another step toward a full Octane refactoring! Glimmer components are coming next. 

Bootstrap users can check out the full list of changes in the [changelog](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). For breaking changes, give [ember-bootstrap-codemods](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap-codemods) a try. We are appreciative of all the codemods in the Ember community!

Not familiar with ember-bootstrap? It's an ember-cli addon that provides a collection of native Ember components that mimic the [original Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) plugins and components in an Ember-friendly way, replacing the need for `bootstrap.js`. For more info, check out the [website](https://www.ember-bootstrap.com/) and the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-bootstrap).
