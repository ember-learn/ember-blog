## [#EmberJS2019 🛣🗺](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)
  
🚨 Blog posts wanted! 🚨 

We would like you to write a blog post to propose **goals and direction** for Ember for the next year. The content of these posts will help the Core Team to draft their **next Roadmap RFC**. Don't have a blog? #EmberJS2019 tweets or GitHub Gists are a-ok! Please share your posts by **Monday, June 17th**. 

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html">Read more about the Roadmap RFC</a>

Looking to see what's already out there? Posts are being gathered at [this community repo](https://github.com/abhilashlr/emberjs2019-posts) - thanks [@abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr)! We also wanted to share some highlights from posts out there in the Times.

[@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) wants Ember to [Build a Larger Community](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/05/26/emberjs2019-build-a-larger-community/).

> Our community, while [truly amazing and supportive](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/04/12/the-ember-times-issue-93.html), is yet small. To flourish, we need **support from developers who don’t work with Ember daily**. These developers may professionally work with React, Angular, or Vue. They may be self-taught or attending school, looking to enter tech with minimal risk in career trajectory and minimal time to create showcase projects.

He shares three concrete ideas to make growing Ember a reality:

1. Publish a better [website](https://emberjs.com/) - address design and content
2. Promote [Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) heavily
3. Teach Ember at local and remote [Meetups](https://emberjs.com/community/meetups)

We are excited to announce that [@rwwagner90](https://github.com/rwwagner90) has joined the [Learning Core Team](https://emberjs.com/team/) and will continue to champion the work on **[Ember Inspector](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector)**! You may recall that [we featured Robert](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-robert-wagner/16143) in a past issue as part of our ["I contribute to Ember"](https://discuss.emberjs.com/c/community) series, where we interview members of our open source community. Congrats! 🎉

## [🧪 Preview Version of ember-query-params-service](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-query-params-service)
This is an experiment to see if using decorators and a separate service to manage query params is a feasible alternative
to the existing query params implementation. We all **know** that query params in ember need to be fixed, and this is just one possible solution. It's a **very early** preview and is expected to have bugs. Should you choose to go on an adventure with this, please feel free to report weird or unexpected behavior. There will be an accompanying RFC to follow soon. 😉
