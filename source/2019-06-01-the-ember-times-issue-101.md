## [#EmberJS2019 🛣🗺](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html)
  
🚨 Blog posts wanted! 🚨 

We would like you to write a blog post to propose **goals and direction** for Ember for the next year. The content of these posts will help the Core Team to draft their **next Roadmap RFC**. Don't have a blog? #EmberJS2019 tweets or GitHub Gists are a-ok! Please share your posts by **Monday, June 17th**. 

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/05/20/ember-2019-roadmap-call-for-posts.html">Read more about the Roadmap RFC</a>

Looking to see what's already out there? Posts are being gathered at [this community repo](https://github.com/abhilashlr/emberjs2019-posts) - thanks [@abhilashlr](https://github.com/abhilashlr)! We also wanted to share some highlights from posts out there in the Times.

[@ijlee2](https://github.com/ijlee2) wants Ember to [Build a Larger Community](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/05/26/emberjs2019-build-a-larger-community/).

> Our community, while [truly amazing and supportive](https://blog.emberjs.com/2019/04/12/the-ember-times-issue-93.html), is yet small. To flourish, we need **support from developers who don’t work with Ember daily**. These developers may professionally work with React, Angular, or Vue. They may be self-taught or attending school, looking to enter tech with minimal risk in career trajectory and minimal time to create showcase projects.

He shares three concrete ideas to make growing Ember a reality:

1. Publish a better [website](https://emberjs.com/) - address design and content
2. Promote [Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) heavily
3. Teach Ember at local and remote [Meetups](https://emberjs.com/community/meetups)

> I hope query params get some love in #EmberJS2019. Biggest pain point of the framework right now imo.

---

[@sbatson5](https://github.com/sbatson5) addresses [lower employability when using Ember](https://imposter-syndrome.lol/posts/a-few-thoughts-on-ember/) and wishes that,

> My hope is that Ember keeps leaning into the conventions that the rest of the JavaScript world have adopted and that those with experience in Vue or React can jump into an Ember project and not feel lost.

[@astronomersiva](https://github.com/astronomersiva) suggests [several ideas for increasing developer experience](https://siva.dev/ember-2019/).

> What I would like to see in this year's edition of Ember is developer friendliness. There are certain simple things that are annoyingly difficult to accomplish on EmberJS or are confusing to developers.

[@andrewcallahan](https://github.com/andrewcallahan) analyzes why Ember lost popular adoption and [shares a solution to using components first and foremost](http://andrewcallahan.com/to-have-a-future-ember-must-kill-its-past/).

> Instead of asking “what do we need to *add* to Ember to make it better” we should instead be asking “what do we need to *remove* from Ember to make it better”. **Specifically I believe that Ember 4.0 should eliminate the concepts of Routes, Controllers, and Templates in favor of Components.**

[@chadhietala](https://github.com/chadhietala) examines [routing, single file format, and shipping what's due](https://gist.github.com/chadhietala/50b977a7d3476069892d351c65af418c).

> I believe it's time to re-think the routing layer and make it feel more cohesive with the rest of the framework. While there is a large portion of the API that is nice there are noticable warts around the mental model of the router, routes, controllers and templates, query params, redirects/aborts.
