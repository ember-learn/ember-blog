## [Let Your Voice Be Heard in the 2019 Ember Community Survey 🗣](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/)

With 2019 already under way the Ember Core team would like your help to learn about who is in the Ember community and how they work with the framework. [The 2019 Ember Community Survey](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/) is anonymous and only open until **March 12th**!

Be sure to [take survey today](https://emberjs.com/ember-community-survey-2019/) and **spread the word** among your colleagues and Ember friends!

## [Ember 3.8 Released 🚀](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html)

New versions of Ember, Ember CLI and Ember Data have been released. Not only does this release contain features like the **Element Modifier Manager and the array helper** - it also marks 3.8 as a new LTS candidate. Both the features and the LTS information can be found in the [release post](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html).

This release also contains 5 deprecations for Ember, so if you plan on upgrading to 3.8 please have a look at the [new deprecations](https://emberjs.com/blog/2019/02/27/ember-3-8-released.html#toc_deprecations-5).

## [RFC for Single-File Components & Template Import Primitives](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/454) 🔬
[@tomdale](https://github.com/tomdale) recently opened up an RFC to explore adding single-file components and module imports in component templates!

The **SFC & Template Import Primitives RFC** proposes adding experimental low-level primitives for embedding templates in JavaScript and associating templates with component classes, two highly-requested features. 🎉

Rather than proposing specific formats for single-file components and template imports, the RFC proposes new low-level API's that addons can use to implement experimental 🧪 file formats.

Be sure to checkout and comment on the detailed design of the [SFC & Template Import Primitives RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/454) on Github!

## [Contribution Guides in FCP! 🖊️](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446)

[@jessica-jordan](https://github.com/jessica-jordan) proposed adding an official **Contribution Guide** which aims to improve the discoverability of Ember-related projects that require help by the community and outlines the general contribution workflow for these projects.

With the intent of making the Contribution Guides as beginner-friendly as possible, it will include a **summary** of the motivation of open-source and its meaning for Ember as an OSS project, a real-world example of **how to contribute code**, a guide on **how to file an issue**, and an **issue finder** inspired by the [What Can I Do for Mozilla landing page](https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/).

<!--alex ignore period-->
The [Contribution Guides RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/446) is in Final Comment Period (FCP) so check it out!

## [Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC 🕳](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/451)

[@pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) opened an RFC around making `getOwner` and explicit injections work in classic class constructors since the [Native Class Constructor Update RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0337-native-class-constructor-update.md) changed the way that classic classes were constructed.

The **Classic Class Owner Tunnel RFC** proposes to make _explicit_ injections work for the class’s constructor method. However, _implicit_ injections will still only be available during `init`, because they are passed in and assigned as `args`. The _implicit_ injections will be caught using development-mode assertions which would direct users to add the injection explicitly (ideally), or to use `init`.

## [Help Wanted 🚧](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3AOctane)

A large part of the work for **Octane** ⛽️ is documentation! **Would you like to help?** Check out [these issues](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3AOctane)! Drop by the [#dev-ember-learning](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888) channel on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) if you want to help out or have any questions. The goal is to make the upcoming edition information clear for both new learners and existing Ember developers, and along the way, do some general refactors of our guides content.
