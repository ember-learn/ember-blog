## [Community support for the Ember API Docs 📓❤️](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs)

The [Ember API Docs](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release) have been one of the cornerstones of Ember's official learning resources since the early days of the project.

But did you already know that right now there are plenty of efforts underway to modernise the app? In this regard, we'd like to thank [Gaurav Munjal (@Gaurav0)](https://github.com/Gaurav0) in particular for bringing in [lots of new upgrades, awesome refactors and improvements to the API Docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3AGaurav0) ❤️!

If you are interested in **helping** with modernising the Ember API Docs - be it contributing code, triaging issues, or reviewing changes - make sure to chat with the Ember Learning team. You can do so either on  [an issue discussion on Github](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/issues) or on the **#dev-ember-learning** channel through the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/emberjs)!

## [Release of ember-arg-types 🍎🍊](https://twitter.com/jonkilroy/status/1242639546749255681)

[Jon Kilroy (@jkusa)](https://github.com/jkusa) released the `ember-arg-types` library which provides a decorator (`@arg`) that maps [glimmer arguments](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/upgrading/current-edition/glimmer-components/) to local component properties. This allows default values and type checking to be declared and documented in your component JS file.

In this example, `sortBy` will return the string argument passed or will default to the string `’id’`:

```js
@arg(string)
sortBy = 'id';
```

Instead of writing something like this:

```js
get sortBy() {
  const { sortBy='id' } = this.args;
  assert('`sortBy` must be a string', typeof sortBy === 'string');
  return sortBy;
}
```

Furthermore `ember-arg-types` leverages the [facebook/prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) library by importing type validators for runtime type checking. As an example, the `name` argument below is required to be a string.

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { arg } from 'ember-arg-types';
import { string } from 'prop-types';

export default class CharacterComponent extends Component {
  // `name` string arg that is required
  @arg(string.isRequired)
  name;
}
```

Try it out today by ember installing [ember-arg-types](https://github.com/jkusa/ember-arg-types)!

## [Ember CLI improvement tips 🚀](https://gist.github.com/vasind/22122632be15f3bc98a092ab012524e2)

[Vasanth (@vasind)](https://github.com/vasind) collated a list of all [**Ember CLI**](https://ember-cli.com/) improvements for Ember applications as a GitHub gist. He showcased improvements to the `ember-cli-build.js` that speed up build times for development and test environments, while retaining the right configurations in production. He also added tips on optimizing applications using [Mirage](https://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/). [Head out to his gist](https://gist.github.com/vasind/22122632be15f3bc98a092ab012524e2) to check them out!

## [Betas of Glimmer.js 2 🎉](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/releases)

A set of **new betas for Glimmer.js 2.0.0** ([beta.1](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.1) && [beta.3](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.3)) have been released! 🔥🔥🔥 

The releases incorporate some exciting new developments including a new minimal `renderComponent` API, a template import based design, a standardized build based on plain JavaScript modules, a new Glimmer.js app blueprint, and support for custom helpers and modifiers. The standardized build emulates the goals of Embroider in Ember.js and unlocks the ability to use whatever custom build pipeline you might want (WebPack, Parcel, Rollup, etc.)!

The Glimmer.js betas could pave the way for what we might want to do in Ember.js, and even what we might _not_ want to do in Ember.js. Please note that these new Glimmer.js betas are definitely experimental. 🔬🧪 Have fun exploring them 🤠, but keep this in mind when considering them for use in your application.
