## [Release of ember-component-template-colocation-migrator 1.1.0 🎉](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

The [ember-component-template-colocation-migrator](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator) codemod co-locates component JS and HBS files as described in the [Component Templates Co-location RFC](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0481-component-templates-co-location.html). The v1.1.0 release adds [support for migrating addons](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator/pull/14), but templates shared by multiple components are excluded. In this case, it is up to end users how to list those; they are reported in the same way other skipped templates (like partials) are. Similarly, mixins that use layout are not migrated.

When running the codemod, instead of:


```sh
your-addon/
  addon/
    components/
      some-component.js
    templates/
      components/
        some-component.hbs
```

You will get:

```sh
your-addon/
  addon/
    components/
      some-component.js
      some-component.hbs
```

Try it out today by running the migrator in your app or addon: `npx github:ember-codemods/ember-component-template-colocation-migrator`
