The release includes performance improvements for fetching relationships via `links` and the new `@model` syntax in Route templates as described in [Request for Comments (RFC) No. 523](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.html), among other updates. Additionally, the [Octane Preview](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) continues in the latest version of Ember - allowing you to try out Ember Octane in your app today!

## ["I contribute to Ember" with Ryan Mark 👨‍💻](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-ryan-mark/17242)

</div>

In our **thirteenth edition** of our contributor interview series, community member [Ryan Mark @tylerturdenpants](https://github.com/tylerturdenpants), talks about his work on codemods. Ryan was an early contributor to The Ember Times in its nascent days! He did a lot of work with Puppeteer on [ember-times-tools](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-times-tools), a tool to convert Times blog posts to Goodbits, our email provider. Puppeteer is also what [ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers](https://github.com/ember-codemods/ember-codemods-telemetry-helpers) uses. 🔗

We’d like to thank Ryan for his contributions to the Ember community, in addition to his financial contribution to cover the Ember Times Goodbits subscription for the last year! 👏 Check out the full interview on [the Ember Discuss forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-ryan-mark/17242).

<p style="font-style: italic;">The idea behind these interviews is to provide community members with more information and insight into open source contributions, learning resources and community events. Contributors to the community gain a platform to share their thoughts on their own experiences and learnings as they were contributing to Ember. Our hope is that it gives first-time and advancing contributors a better sense of the fact that everyone starts out small, and that anyone can have a big impact on the community.</p>

## [Readers' Questions: "Any plans to improve the DDAU experience in the future?" 🤓](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-are-there-plans-to-improve-the-experience-for-using-data-down-actions-up-in-the-future/17239)

<div class="blog-row">
  <img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Office Hours Tomster Mascot" title="Readers' Questions" src="/images/tomsters/officehours.png" />

  <p>This week's Readers' Question focusses on a common pattern for managing state in Ember apps: <strong>Data Down, Actions Up (DDAU)</strong>. Even though DDAU is the <i>Ember way</i> to build applications, it at times doesn't seem to come intuitively to those who use the framework. Are there any plans to <strong>improve the developer experience</strong> for DDAU in Ember apps for the future?</p>

  <p>You can find out in this week's Readers' Question! Read all about the future of DDAU and how Ember will help you to apply this useful pattern on <a href="https://github.com/jessica-jordan" target="jj">Jessica Jordan's (@jessica-jordan)</a> answer on <a href="https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-are-there-plans-to-improve-the-experience-for-using-data-down-actions-up-in-the-future/17239" target="discuss">the official Ember forum</a>!</p>
