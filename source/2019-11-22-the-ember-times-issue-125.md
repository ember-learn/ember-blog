## ["I contribute to Ember" with Ryan Mark 👨‍💻](update me!)

<div class="float-right padded portrait-frame">
  <img alt="Ryan Mark" title="Ryan Mark - Contributor to Ember" src="/images/blog/emberjstimes/ryan_mark.jpeg" />
</div>

In our **thirteenth edition** of our contributor interview series, community member [Ryan Mark @tylerturdenpants](https://github.com/tylerturdenpants), talks about his work on ... Thank you for your contributions to the Ember community, Ryan!

You can read the full interview on [the Ember Discuss Forum](update me!).

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="update me!">Read more</a>

<p style="font-style: italic;">The idea behind these interviews is to provide community members with more information and insight into open source contributions, learning resources and community events. Contributors to the community gain a platform to share their thoughts on their own experiences and learnings as they were contributing to Ember. Our hope is that it gives first-time and advancing contributors a better sense of the fact that everyone starts out small, and that anyone can have a big impact on the community.</p>
