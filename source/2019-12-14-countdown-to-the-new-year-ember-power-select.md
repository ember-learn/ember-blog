### What It Does

Ember Power Select provides a powerful select component, built from the ground up for Ember so that it works the way you expect an addon to work in Ember. Exceptionally [well-documented](https://ember-power-select.com/docs), Ember Power Select allows you to create everything from a straightforward list of text items to an asynchronous search driven select which incorporates graphical elements in the list. 

The addon's website includes a [cookbook](https://ember-power-select.com/cookbook) for more unusual requirements as well as a [list of community provided addons](https://ember-power-select.com/addons) which address functionality outside of the scope of Ember Power Select.

### Why I Like It

<!--alex ignore just-->
I have grown to love using Ember Power Select while developing a CRUD-rich web app which benefits from many instances of select elements driven by asynchronous searches. I have made use of the [cookbook](https://ember-power-select.com/cookbook) to debounce those searches and so reduce the load on the server while maintaining a slick feel to the interface. The look of the resulting selects is fine just as they are, but the [well-documented API](https://ember-power-select.com/docs/api-reference) has allowed me to tweak each use of the addon and to provide a better experience to the users.

Although [some work](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-select/issues/1251) has been done to support Octane it appears that as of today this isn't yet complete. If you are interested in helping out with this addon, check the repository to see what issues remain!

Do you use this addon? Or one like it? We'd love to hear about Ember addons that bring you joy!
