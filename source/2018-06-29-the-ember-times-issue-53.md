## [Need for Speed: Ember Edition - Speed Up Ember Builds](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/7645)

<p>Have Ember CLI build times been causing you <span style="font-style: italic;">grief</span>? Do you want to shave 20 seconds from your rebuilds?</p>

[Tomasz Smykowski](https://github.com/tomaszs) has been experimenting with building on [SSD vs RAM Disk](https://emberjs-developer.quora.com/How-to-make-Ember-js-CLI-ember-s-32-times-faster). He has seen up to **32x** speed improvements! Speedups were found when upgrading to a faster processor and using an SSD.

Upgrading RAM wasn't found to be helpful however the biggest gain was found by using a **RAM disk** to hold the project folder which allowed 3x speed gains during builds. The drawback of this is that when the computer shuts down the RAM disk is wiped clean (so make sure you commit often!).
[Tobias Bieniek](https://github.com/Turbo87) chimed in that current efforts to integrate Broccoli 2 into Ember CLI are underway and that most platforms would get this speedup by default once the usually RAM Disk powered, system temporary folder instead of the current _in-project_ `tmp` folder is used due to the Broccoli update.

Look for this speedup soon in an Ember App near you!

## [Oh, No(de) He Didn't!](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import)
[Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) has just released version 1.0 of `ember-auto-import`. This addon allows you to add dependencies using NPM or Yarn with **zero configuration**. It can be used both in apps and addons and deduplicates correctly across all addons and the app itself.

All you have to do is type `ember install ember-auto-import` and you’re ready to add whatever dependency you want to your project using NPM or yarn.

Read all about the version 1.0 release on the [forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-auto-import-1-0-released/14997).

## [Transforms: More than Meets the Eye 👀](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/343)

[@Alonski](https://github.com/Alonski) composed an RFC to deprecate the usage of Transforms in Ember Data.  The RFC gathered some attention. Although the core reason for the RFC was discussed, [a comment](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/343#issuecomment-400382952) by <a href="https://github.com/runspired" target="gh-user">@runspired</a>, one of the maintainers of Ember Data, stands out from the rest:
Recently the Ember Data team has met and discussed deprecating the transforms, yet leaving them as a feature of the **current** model layer. **Current model layer?** There is another model layer? Yes! Because of the most recent [RecordData RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/293), Ember Data is now poised to accept alternative model layers.

If you are interested in what an alternative model layer looks like, check out [ember-m3](https://github.com/hjdivad/ember-m3). That's not all, the comments on this RFC also give us a glimpse into Ember Data's future - there are RFCs coming (not yet published) that  will eventually split up Ember Data into multiple packages.

Interested in the whole conversation? Checkout [@Alonski's](https://github.com/Alonski) RFC [here](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/343).

## [Readers' Questions: “Can I start using Module Unification in my app?”](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-can-i-start-using-module-unification-in-my-app/15029)

<div class="blog-row">
  <img class="float-right small transparent padded" alt="Office Hours Tomster Mascot" title="Readers' Questions" src="/images/tomsters/officehours.png" />

  <p>This week's Readers' Question dives into the realm of cutting-edge Ember features: The avid Ember Times
  reader <code>sandstrom</code> asks if and how you're able to <strong>use Module Unification (MU)</strong> - a reformed way to structure your app's project directory - in your Ember application today.
  Is it true that you can have your own, MU-structured project already?</p>

   <p>In her detailed answer to this question, Ember Learning team member <a href="https://github.com/jenweber" target="githubjen">@jenweber</a> explains which <strong>benefits</strong> MU brings to your Ember app
   and also if it can be used today already. You can <a href="https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/readers-questions-can-i-start-using-module-unification-in-my-app/15029" target="rq2">read the full answer on the official Ember Forum</a>.</p>
