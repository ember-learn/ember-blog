## [LexasCMS releases official support for JSON:API and more! üéâ](https://www.lexascms.com/blog/introducing-the-jsonapi-content-delivery-api/)

Have you been looking to integrate a headless CMS with your Ember.js application?

LexasCMS recently shipped a new **JSON:API compliant content delivery API** which aims to make this integration easier than ever before.

Read the [release blog post](https://www.lexascms.com/blog/introducing-the-jsonapi-content-delivery-api/) for more information.

Simply install the addon, configure your space ID and application adapters/serializers, and begin pulling content directly from LexasCMS using Ember Data.

You can visit the addon's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LexasCMS/ember-data-lexascms) for more details.

### [Ember.js Integration Guide for LexasCMS üìï](https://www.lexascms.com/docs/integrations/ember-js/)

Check out the [full integration guide](https://www.lexascms.com/docs/integrations/ember-js/) on the LexasCMS website.

## [Tweaking UI behavior with Ember Data queries üìù](https://codingitwrong.com/2020/06/23/ember-list.html)


[Josh Justice (@CodingItWrong)](https://github.com/codingitwrong) has a new [blog post](https://codingitwrong.com/2020/06/23/ember-list.html) about Ember Data, his favorite part of Ember.js. Josh writes about building a todo list application, [Surely](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/surely-ember). He touches on querying with JSON:API, the basics of working with the model, sorting with Ember Data, the nuances of reloading, and more. Check out [Tweaking UI behavior with Ember Data queries] and the accompanying [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodingItWrong/surely-ember) to learn more about putting Ember Data to use!

## [What is reactivity? üí°](https://dev.to/theaswathprabhu/what-is-reactivity-116f)

<!-- alex disable just -->
A key feature of Ember Octane is the new **reactivity** model. In essence, reactivity is **deciding what to rerender and when**. A good reactivity model can help us focus on business logic because the rerender _just works_.
<!-- alex enable just -->

To illustrate this point, [Aswathprabhu R.](https://dev.to/theaswathprabhu) shared a blog post titled [What is Reactivity?](https://dev.to/theaswathprabhu/what-is-reactivity-116f). You will learn what updating the DOM manually may look like in vanilla JavaScript, then how frameworks like React and [Ember](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/in-depth-topics/autotracking-in-depth/) help separate the rerender logic.

We encourage you to check out Aswathprabhu's [explanation of reactivity](https://dev.to/theaswathprabhu/what-is-reactivity-116f) today!

## Blog post series of lessons learned working with Ember üìî

[Johan Ronsse (@Wolfr)](https://github.com/Wolfr) wrote a series of blog posts on working with Ember especially coming from a [designer‚Äôs point of view](https://mono.company/frontend/working-within-ember-designer-point-of-view/). The blog explains how [angle bracket and other Octane features](https://mono.company/frontend/getting-to-grips-with-ember/) make invoking components feel like writing HTML for designers.

The blog also showcases a [button component](https://mono.company/frontend/doing-more-with-a-smaller-team-an-ember-octane-example/) to illustrate how a good public interface helps end users be effective. The code that they have to write is simpler, which prevents them from introducing errors.

Finally, the last blog post covers [nifty tools](https://mono.company/frontend/working-within-ember-designer-point-of-view/) that the Ember ecosystem provides. Addons make the complicated understandable and codemods help everyone move to the latest Ember release as soon as it becomes available.

Read all three blogs in the series below:

- [Getting to grips with Ember](https://mono.company/frontend/getting-to-grips-with-ember/)
- [Doing more with a smaller team: a button component example](https://mono.company/frontend/doing-more-with-a-smaller-team-an-ember-octane-example/)
- [Working in an Ember codebase from a designer point of view](https://mono.company/frontend/working-within-ember-designer-point-of-view/)
