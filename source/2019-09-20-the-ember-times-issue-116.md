## [Octane Super Rentals Tutorial 🚀](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/01-orientation/)

[@chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) and [@vaidehijoshi](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi) did some great work writing content and creating a tutorial code generator that runs commands, inserts the code into a tutorial, and even takes screenshots. You can now preview the [Octane guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/01-orientation/) and check out the tutorial.

What’s amazing is that this tutorial is **automatically generated**. It runs the commands and edits the files the same way that the reader would. It even captures the output and screenshots. This way, if any steps stopped working due to a change in Ember itself, we would know right away from a CI failure.

If you are looking to contribute check out the [super-rentals-tutorial repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial)!
