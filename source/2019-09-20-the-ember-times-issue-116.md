## [Octane Super Rentals Tutorial 🚀](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/00-part-1/)

[Godfrey Chan @chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) and [Vaidehi Joshi @vaidehijoshi](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi) did some great work writing new content for the revamped Super Rentals tutorial. You can now preview the [Octane guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/00-part-1/) and check out the [tutorial](https://super-rentals-tutorial--ember-super-rentals.netlify.com/).

What’s more amazing about this [Super Rentals tutorial](https://super-rentals-tutorial--ember-super-rentals.netlify.com/) is that it is **automatically generated**. It runs the commands from markdown files and edits the files the same way that the reader would. It even captures the output and screenshots for the published tutorial. This way, if any steps stopped working due to a change in Ember itself, we would know right away from a CI failure.

If you are looking to contribute, or if you have any feedback on the content, check out the [super-rentals-tutorial repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial)!

  <p>Recently, the Ember community of <strong>Нижний Новгород ("Nizhny Novgorod")</strong> came together
  for the first event of <a href="https://emberjs-nn.timepad.ru/events/" target="niz" rel="noopener">Nizhny's EmberJS meetup group</a>.
  The event was a huge success and featured insightful talks around JavaScript, Ember, testing best practices and much more.
  Event organiser <a href="https://twitter.com/NataliFel" target="natali" rel="noopener">@NataliFel</a> shared highlights from the meetup,
  including these amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/NataliFel/status/1170245679849099264" target="tomstercookies" rel="noopener">Tomster cookies</a>!</p>
