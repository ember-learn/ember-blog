## [Meet `@model` for Route Templates 🆕](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ac27abbd1729cd61b67465eee4c8096bb47501da/text/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.md)

Starting with Ember Octane (3.14), you can use a **named argument**, `@model`, in the route template to refer to your data from the `model()` hook. The [Ember Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/) have been [updated](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1044) to show uses of `@model`.

```handlebars
<h2>List of Scientists</h2>

<ul>
  {{#each @model as |scientist|}}
    <li>{{scientist}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

[`@model` was introduced](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ac27abbd1729cd61b67465eee4c8096bb47501da/text/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.md) to help new developers quickly learn templates. By avoiding `this.model`, they would not need to understand another concept—the controller—to build their first Octane app. By using a named argument, we can also reinforce the idea that `@` is used to denote things that are "passed as arguments" to the template.

You can [try out `@model` now on canary](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/18363/files), or wait for 3.14 beta next week!
