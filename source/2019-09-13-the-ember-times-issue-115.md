## [Meet `@model` for Route Templates üÜï](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ac27abbd1729cd61b67465eee4c8096bb47501da/text/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.md)

Starting with Ember Octane (3.14), you can use a **named argument**, `@model`, in the route template to refer to your data from the `model()` hook. The [Ember Octane Guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/) have been [updated](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1044) to show uses of `@model`.

```handlebars
<h2>List of Scientists</h2>

<ul>
  {{#each @model as |scientist|}}
    <li>{{scientist}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

[`@model` was introduced](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/ac27abbd1729cd61b67465eee4c8096bb47501da/text/0523-model-argument-for-route-templates.md) to help new developers quickly learn templates. By avoiding `this.model`, they would not need to understand another concept‚Äîthe controller‚Äîto build their first Octane app. By using a named argument, we can also reinforce the idea that `@` is used to denote things that are "passed as arguments" to the template.

You can [try out `@model` now on canary](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/18363/files), or wait for 3.14 beta next week!

The Apple Music web application [was launched](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851576/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming) for public beta for subscribers at [beta.music.apple.com](https://beta.music.apple.com). [Through](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d0hdeo/the_new_official_apple_music_app_for_the_web_is/?utm_source=ifttt) [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs/comments/d06pcn/new_apple_music_web_app_built_in_ember/) [reports](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6575525024327884800/), it was [confirmed](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6575756074194993152/) that the new Apple Music website is an Ember application. Furthermore, the new [tv.apple.com](https://tv.apple.com) landing and content pages are also [built with Ember](https://twitter.com/mehulkar/status/1171579484115353605)!

[Share your thoughts](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/apple-music-beta-is-an-ember-app/17026) on having more high profile examples of Ember applications!

## [API Doc Updates üìù](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pulls?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+%5BDOC%5D)

Thanks to [Ricardo Mendes (@locks)](https://github.com/locks) and team for working on [Octanify-ing the API docs](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pulls?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+%5BDOC%5D)! These documentation upgrades are part of the [Quest Issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18250) to update the API docs to show Octane and Native Classes. [Jen Weber (@jenweber)](https://github.com/jenweber) has provided **detailed step-by-step instructions**, a YUIDoc styleguide, and some examples on the [Quest Issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18250), encouraging interested contributors to post in [#dev-ember-learning](https://discordapp.com/channels/480462759797063690/480777444203429888) on the [Ember Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/zT3asNS) with any questions.

Another API docs issue that is gaining steam is [Improve documentation of EmberArray](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18228). Going through [http://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/EmberArray](http://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/EmberArray), you will notice that some of the entries have minimal documentation and no code sample. The goal is to review each entry, add code samples where missing, and optionally improve the prose. Comment on the thread in the [EmberArray issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18228) to contribute.

## [What Makes the Transition to Ember Worthwhile: A New Community Member's Perspective üêπ](https://twitter.com/lenoraporter_/status/1170145563549061122)

In a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/lenoraporter_/status/1170145563549061122), Senior Product Designer [Lenora Porter (@lenoraporter_)](https://twitter.com/lenoraporter_)
shared a [video](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B2CCM60AOZG/?igshid=12ivaiobj1y8h) to pitch the **most interesting learnings** about Ember to those transitioning from other tech stacks.

Lenora, who has prior experience in React, talks about useful learning resources for those starting out Ember and what makes the transition worthwhile. In addition to Convention over Configuration and integrated tooling, she highlights how a supportive community makes learning Ember very straightforward.

## [Ember Sinon QUnit 4.0 Released üéâ](https://twitter.com/JordanHawker/status/1170107247118053376)

[Jordan Hawker (@elwayman02)](https://github.com/elwayman02) and [Steve Calvert (@scalvert)](https://github.com/scalvert) teamed up to bring us the best [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/) experience possible. üíû

Thanks to their work, [ember-sinon-qunit v4](https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit) allows us to do a one-time setup, use the `sinon` object directly in our tests, and never worry about cleaning up mocks after the tests are run. To learn more about the motivation for change and the new syntax, you can check out [Jordan's blog post](https://www.jordanhawker.com/p/187541610821) and the [addon's README file](https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit#usage).

If you have been using Steve's [ember-sinon-sandbox](https://github.com/scalvert/ember-sinon-sandbox) or [ember-sinon-sinoff](https://github.com/scalvert/ember-sinon-sinoff), please check the [README file](https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-sinon-qunit#migrating-to-ember-sinon-qunit) to choose your migration path.
