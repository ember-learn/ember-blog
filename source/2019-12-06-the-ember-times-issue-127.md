In our **fourteenth edition** of our contributor interview series, community member [Ben Demboski (@bendemboski)](https://github.com/bendemboski) talks about his work on [ember-electron](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-electron).

We’d like to thank Ben for his contributions to the Ember community, and for all of his help keeping ember-electron up and running!

Check out the full interview on [the Ember Discuss forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-ben-demboski/17294).

<p style="font-style: italic;">The idea behind these interviews is to provide community members with more information and insight into open source contributions, learning resources and community events. Contributors to the community gain a platform to share their thoughts on their own experiences and learnings as they were contributing to Ember. Our hope is that it gives first-time and advancing contributors a better sense of the fact that everyone starts out small, and that anyone can have a big impact on the community.</p>

## [A Reminder to Help Test the New Inspector 🔬](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1088)

Following last week's announcement about the awesome new work being done on **Ember Inspector** to support Octane 🔥, please don't forget to help test the new changes and let the Inspector team know about your experiences (positive or negative).

The Inspector changes in question are currently still in a [pull request](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/pull/1088), so if you're interested in taking it for a spin, you'll have to follow the instructions in the PR's description. Note: These instructions are not the same as installing Inspector in the usual manner for your browser.

Please feel free to report any success stories or issues either in the PR or in the `#st-octane` channel of Discord.

While the new changes relate primarly to suppport of Octane, it would be very helpful to test this particular build of the Inspector on older versions of Ember as well! 😊
