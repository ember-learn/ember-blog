## [EmberFest 2019 CFP is now open! 📝](https://cfp.emberfest.eu)

[EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu/) – the European Community Ember Conference – will be held at [Mogens Dahl](https://mogensdahl.dk) in Copenhagen this year from October 17-18, 2019. They have recently [announced](https://twitter.com/EmberFest/status/1125441719921717251) that the CFP is **now open** with a deadline at August 1, 2019.

EmberFest is looking for a wide range of talks, from in-depth technical talks to broader talks covering other aspects of software development. While Ember-related is best, EmberFest is open to considering talks that cover more general software / tech related topics that would be of interest to Ember developers.

[Submit your talk today!](https://cfp.emberfest.eu/events/emberfest-2019)

## [Build a GitHub Gist Clone in Octane ⛽️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JfNuppX1n8)

In this free video tutorial, [Program with Erik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshZ3rdoCLjDYuTR_RBubzw) and [Jeffrey Biles](https://courses.happyprogrammer.net/) pair program on building a simplified GitHub Gist clone in Octane. Jeffrey explains how Octane is a set of features bundled together to create a **new programming experience**. This video is geared toward beginners, folks coming from other frameworks, or people who are coming back to Ember after awhile! Share it with a friend?

In addition to using the Octane blueprint, the tutorial makes use of [ember-prism](https://github.com/shipshapecode/ember-prism) and [ember-animated](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated). Check out the recording and use the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ErikCH/octane-example) as a reference to code along at home.

## [Ember Event Dispatcher Clean Up for Several Mouse Events 🐁💥](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/486)

Since the early beginnings of Ember, the **Ember Event Dispatcher** handled the delegation of browser events in an application.
But some events are harder to delegate to the Dispatcher than others. In particular, the `mouseenter`🕳 ⬅️🐁 and the `mouseleave` 🕳🐁➡️ events need to be handled differently because they do not bubble up - a characteristic that Ember's Event Dispatcher usually relies on for event delegation.

In a [new RFC](https://github.com/simonihmig/rfcs/blob/deprecate-mouseenter/text/0486-deprecate-mouseenter.md), the writer of [RFC #386](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0386-remove-jquery.html) is back with a proposal to reduce the overhead of event handling for these rarely used event types.
In his proposal, [@simonihmig](https://github.com/simonihmig) suggests the deprecation of `mouseleave` and `mouseenter` events in Ember's Event Dispatcher in favor of using native event listeners.

Read more about the **motivation** and the **transition path** for the proposed change [in the original RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/486) and be sure to leave your questions, thoughts or suggestions in the comments below! ✍️
