We're thrilled to announce that [EmberConf 2023](https://www.emberconf.com) will take place on July 20-21 at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, OR. The venue is state-of-the-art and fully accessible. We're excited to offer both in-person and live online attendance options. [Tickets are on sale now](http://www.emberconf.com)!

This is the first conference back in person since the pandemic, and we're taking all the necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone attending in person (check out the [FAQ page](https://www.emberconf.com/faqs) for details on our specific precautions). For those attending online, we're working hard to provide an engaging and interactive experience as well. You might not be there with us in person, but we’ll try our best to make everyone feel included!

As we celebrate 10 years since Ember 1.0, we’ll focus on not just Ember’s longevity, but Ember’s modern-day community. The talks and workshops have been specifically chosen to help meet users where they are right now, and the practical challenges they face day-to-day.

We're excited to welcome amazing new and returning speakers, including Yehuda Katz (co-creator of Ember.js), Kenigbolo Meya Stephen, Ed Faulkner, and Julia Donaldson. Whether you're a seasoned Ember developer or just getting started, EmberConf is the perfect opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with the Ember community.

EmberConf is intended to be as inclusive as possible so that anyone and everyone feels comfortable and able to attend. We're offering childcare, private infant feeding spaces, closed captioning, and can accommodate special meal requests. We also have a strong and enforced code of conduct to ensure that everyone is treated with respect and dignity. We also have unlimited Scholarship tickets to our virtual event for students, or anyone who might not otherwise be able to attend.

EmberConf provides attendees with unique opportunities to learn from the best and brightest in the Ember community, as well as to network with other developers and industry professionals. You'll have the chance to ask questions, participate in hands-on workshops, and engage with other attendees in interactive sessions!

Registration is now open, and we encourage you to reserve your spot today. Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to learn and connect with the Ember community!

Do you work for a company that uses Ember? [Pitch them on Sponsoring](https://www.emberconf.com/become-a-sponsor)! We have a variety of sponsorship packages to fit every budget. EmberConf sponsors help make it all happen (seriously, this stuff is expensive!), and every single one makes a big difference.
