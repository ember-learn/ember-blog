<SAYING-HELLO-IN-YOUR-FAVORITE-LANGUAGE> Emberistas! 🐹
EmberFest 2021 is happening! 🏛️,

## [EmberFest 2021 is happening! 🏛️](https://twitter.com/EmberFest/status/1398291012489994241)

Mark your calendars for **September 30–October 1st** of 2021 – [EmberFest](https://emberfest.eu/) will be back as a hybrid on-site/virtual event! EmberFest is the European Community Ember Conference. The location will be a secret until ticket sales are open so stay tuned.

The EmberFest team is confident that this year’s conference can happen in person. At the same time, they realize that some people can’t or might not want to travel yet, so for the first time, EmberFest is going hybrid: there will be both on-site and remote tickets for a livestream available. Early bird tickets will start on **June 11, 2021**.

If you’re interested in seeing what it’s like, check out the last [EmberFest conference in 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EyI_xyha6k) which was in Copenhagen!
