## [🎙️ EmberConf 2023](https://www.emberconf.com)

Two weeks ago, on the 20th and 21st of July about **150 Emberistas** met in Portland (OR) for the first in-person EmberConf since COVID-19. It was amazing to see so many people getting to know each other and sharing knowledge about our framework, EmberJS. Hopefully, you’ve enjoyed the live stream with the [great line-up of speakers](https://www.emberconf.com/speakers). If you have missed it or want to watch something back, the live streams of [day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvrpUrdq5Gc) and [day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDT_WPgK3xI) are already available (but hidden on YouTube). The separate videos will follow later. On the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wks7HMrG), each talk got its own channel, in case you want to get in contact about that talk specifically. Let's get **inspired**!

## 💻 Open Core Team Meetings
<!--alex ignore easily-->
Starting last week, the EmberJS team meetings are open to the public on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/emberjs).

It will also allow you to work together more easily, provide input and get up to date. Checkout the events in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/emberjs) for the time (in your timezone) and dates.

| Day      | Topic |
|----------|---|
| Monday   | Learning team  |
