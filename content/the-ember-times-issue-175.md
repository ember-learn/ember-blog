## [RFC: Official TypeScript support ‚úÖ](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/724)

[Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) put up an [RFC for Official TypeScript support](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/724) in Ember. The goal of the RFC is to determine if we should support [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a first-class citizen in Ember, and if yes, identify any gaps present today.

> Ember officially supporting TypeScript means: All libraries which are installed as part of the default blueprint must ship accurate and up-to-date type definitions for the current edition. These types will uphold a Semantic Versioning commitment which includes a definition of SemVer for TypeScript types as well as a specification of supported compiler versions and settings, so that TypeScript will receive the same stability commitments as the rest of Ember.

- Any addon that is part of the default blueprint must ship types.
- The RFC explicitly does not require support for ‚Äútyped templates‚Äù
- Instead of opting into TypeScript using [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) it should be done by default
- Define a policy on what constitutes a breaking change for consumers of a library which publishes types, including Ember‚Äôs core libraries

Read and comment on the [RFC on GitHub](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/724)!

## [`ember-responsive-image` v2 released üñºÔ∏è](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1369316435621724163)

[ember-responsive-image](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-responsive-image) is an addon created by [Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig). At build time, the addon uses [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) to generate resized images that are optimized for web.

Simon [announced the v2 release](https://twitter.com/simonihmig/status/1369316435621724163), which provides the following features:

- `<ResponsiveImage>` rewritten as a Glimmer component
- Next-gen image formats WebP and AVIF
- Fixed and responsive layouts
- Lazy loading + LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders)
- FastBoot and Embroider support

To learn more how `ember-responsive-image` can help you optimize loading images, we encourage you to check out the following links:

- [README: Basic Usage](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-responsive-image#basic-usage)
- [Maximally Optimizing Image Loading for the Web in 2021](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/image-optimizations/)

## [How Qonto used Mirage JS for complex user flow testing ‚¨ÜÔ∏è](https://medium.com/qonto-way/how-to-handle-uploading-and-parsing-files-in-your-frontend-app-tests-19bee8e7a61f)

[Sabin Hertanu (@herzzanu)](https://github.com/herzzanu) details a **testing challenge** he ran into at [Qonto](https://qonto.com/en) in the article [How to handle uploading and parsing files in your frontend app tests](https://medium.com/qonto-way/how-to-handle-uploading-and-parsing-files-in-your-frontend-app-tests-19bee8e7a61f). In Qonto's Ember app, users can upload a file to their servers for creating transfers in bulk. The server reads, parses, and processes the data before sending a list of transfers in response. Mocking the endpoints to accurately match this full process would take a lot of time and code, in addition to being challenging to maintain and scale.

[Mirage JS](https://miragejs.com/) is a library for mocking API endpoints as [route handlers](https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/route-handlers/) to test JavaScript apps, without having to rely on any backend services. Sabin discusses how Qonto uses Mirage [Factories](https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/factories/) to test this tricky user flow. Check out the walkthrough with test code samples in the [blog post](https://medium.com/qonto-way/how-to-handle-uploading-and-parsing-files-in-your-frontend-app-tests-19bee8e7a61f) to learn about how Qonto mocked the API to make sure it matches what they would expect from the real API in production. Effective testing can pay dividends in improving the developer experience and maintaining the quality of the user experience!
