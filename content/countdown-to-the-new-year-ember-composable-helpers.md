**This is the 18th in our DecEmber series–"Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons". We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 18

Today we are going to look at the 11th most popular addon on Ember Observer: [`ember-composable-helpers`](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-composable-helpers).

### What It Does

The `ember-composable-helper` addon provides composable helpers for Ember apps, which allows for more declarative templating.

Now, the first time I read that sentence, I thought, "huh what?" so I want to break it down a little more. 

This addon provides helpers. Useful helpers (like [`filter-by`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers#filter-by), [`repeat`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers#repeat), and [`group-by`](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers#group-by), to name a few. These helpers can be used together (imagine using `group-by` in conjunction with `filter-by`...go ahead, imagine it, I'll wait...). 

The declarative bit means that we're telling our template _what_ we want to do, succinctly; `ember-composable-helpers` tells our app _how_ to do it, saving us time and increasing our productivity. 

### Why I Like It

I think this addon is the bee's knees. It allows me to write code in the way I wish I could always write code! I love being able to say "here's what I want done, please." I'd rather not have to think too much about the "how", especially not every.single.time. I write code. The team that worked on this addon is known for producing useful addons, too, and I trust their work. Once again, strong community conventions come through for the benefit of all!

Even better, the fantastic team at EmberMap has [a video about this addon](https://embermap.com/video/ember-composable-helpers) if you want to learn more!


Do you use this addon? Or one like it? We'd love to hear about Ember addons that bring you joy!
