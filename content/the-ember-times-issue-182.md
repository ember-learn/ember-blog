## [Using the in-element helper ⛳](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/emberjs-using-in-element-helper-faith-or/)

[Faith Or (@faith-or)](https://github.com/faith-or) wrote a blog post on how they migrated from `ember-wormhole` to the built-in `in-element` helper introduced in Ember 3.20.

[Ember Wormhole](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-wormhole) is an addon that renders a child view somewhere else in the DOM _outside_ of the component.

The [in-element helper](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.20/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/in-element?anchor=in-element) renders its block content outside of the regular flow, into a DOM element given by its `destinationElement` positional argument.

Common use cases for both include when a piece of UI is a logical child of a component but needs to render somewhere else such as a loading screen, a modal, tooltip or even a dropdown. The differences between the two are slight. Faith goes into more detail in the blog post.

There are 3 main takeaways.

1. `in-element` needs the destination to exist before we use it, while `ember-wormhole` does not.
2. With `in-element`, when the destination element changes, the content is re-rendered completely.
3. By default, the `in-element` helper will replace all the contents of the destination element. (You will need to configure it not to using `insertBefore=null`.)

## [Migrating Controllers to top-level Components in Ember 📖](https://dev.to/juanazam/migrating-controllers-to-top-level-components-in-ember-ggc)

In this [blog post](https://dev.to/juanazam/migrating-controllers-to-top-level-components-in-ember-ggc), [Juan Manuel Azambuja (@juanazam)](https://github.com/juanazam) shows a real world example of how to replace your template contents with a single top-level component. The top-level component can then take on a similar role as the controller.

Juan presents a few tricks as well as a useful discussion of using [ember-modifiers](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier) addon to solve updating issues. The blog sums up the advantages and disadvantages of the top-level approach, and cautions that the framework doesn't fully support this solution without some compromises.

## [Ember development on Twitch.tv 📺](https://www.twitch.tv/real_ate/)
  
[Chris Manson @mansona](https://github.com/mansona) has started to stream Ember development on Twitch. In engaging [Twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/real_ate/videos) Chris shows how he does maintenance and development in the Ember ecosystem. Every stream has a nice table of contents and time boxed periods where Chris works on a certain topic.

[Every Thursday at 11:30 - 13:00 (GMT+2)](https://www.twitch.tv/real_ate/schedule), you can join Chris on an adventure through contributing in Open Source, chat with other Ember enthusiasts and get **inspired** to contribute yourself.
