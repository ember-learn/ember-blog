## [🌈 1. New addon for syntax highlighting in Ember](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/ember-shiki)

Have you ever wanted to show pretty code snippets in your Ember apps? Then today you're in luck. The new [ember-shiki](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/ember-shiki) addon was just released by Ignace Maes ([@IgnaceMaes](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes)) which makes using the [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) syntax highlighter in Ember a breeze. It is a modern v2 addon with TypeScript and Glint interfaces and has support for Fastboot. On top of that it comes with theming options, code block grouping, and line highlighting. Ember's new `.gjs` and `.gts` file formats are also supported out of the box.

Give it a try, for all your syntax highlighting needs!

## 🎞️ Learn more about Ember with videos

When talking about the new things in Ember, Glint is a favourite topic. [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho), together with [Dan Freeman (@dfreeman)](https://github.com/dfreeman) are publishing a series of screencast on this topic. Their first screencast has the amazing title: [You did WHAT with TypeScript?—Glint Architecture Overview](https://youtu.be/MLpP8D3cY7M?si=7ro6801LQZtkjaVT), and will explain the big picture of how the Glint project works. In their second screencast, [Vacuous Lies: How the Glint/TypeScript transform works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhv1jAV5cZI), they dig into the details of how Glint transforms EmberJS and GlimmerJS templates into TypeScript.
