## [Octane Super Rentals Tutorial 🚀](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/00-part-1/)

[Godfrey Chan @chancancode](https://github.com/chancancode) and [Vaidehi Joshi @vaidehijoshi](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi) did some great work writing new tutorial content for Octane. You can now preview the [revamped Super Rentals tutorial](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/00-part-1/) in the [Octane guides](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com/).

What’s more amazing about this [Super Rentals tutorial](https://super-rentals-tutorial--ember-super-rentals.netlify.com/) is that it is **automatically generated**. It runs the commands from markdown files and edits the files the same way that the reader would. It even captures the output and screenshots for the published tutorial. This way, if any steps stopped working due to a change in Ember itself, we would know right away from a CI failure.

If you are looking to contribute, or if you have any feedback on the content, check out the [super-rentals-tutorial repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial)!

## ["I contribute to Ember" with Michelle Santarsiero 👩‍💻](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-michelle-santarsiero/17069)

<div class="float-right padded portrait-frame">
  <img alt="Michelle Santarsiero" title="Michelle Santarsiero - Contributor to Ember" src="/images/blog/emberjstimes/michelle_santarsiero.png" />
</div>

In our **twelfth edition** of our contributor interview series, community member [Michelle Santarsiero @lonelyghost](https://github.com/lonelyghost), talks about her work on **Ember Observer**, her journey into open source, and her tips for making **incremental progress** when doing open source on the side. Thank you for your contributions to the Ember community, Michelle!

You can read the full interview on [the Ember Discuss Forum](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-michelle-santarsiero/17069).

<a class="ember-button ember-button--centered" href="https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/i-contribute-to-ember-with-michelle-santarsiero/17069">Read more</a>

<p style="font-style: italic;">The idea behind these interviews is to provide community members with more information and insight into open source contributions, learning resources and community events. Contributors to the community gain a platform to share their thoughts on their own experiences and learnings as they were contributing to Ember. Our hope is that it gives first-time and advancing contributors a better sense of the fact that everyone starts out small, and that anyone can have a big impact on the community.</p>
