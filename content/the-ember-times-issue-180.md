## [Prettier for Handlebars Support 🙌](https://prettier.io/blog/2021/05/09/2.3.0.html#ember--handlebars)

Prettier can now officially format HTML templates with Handlebars (HBS) in the newly released [version 2.3.0](https://prettier.io/blog/2021/05/09/2.3.0.html#ember--handlebars). Thank you to [Cyrille David (@dcyriller)](https://github.com/dcyriller) for pushing this initiative, which started in 2017, through the finish line.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. This removes all bikeshedding on what rules we should have or shouldn’t have and instead provides one standard for everyone to use by default.

In order to keep your project aligned with Prettier’s formatting we can use the Ember Template Lint plugin: [ember-template-lint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/ember-template-lint/ember-template-lint-plugin-prettier). This plugin defines a _single rule_ that rule will compare your code with Prettier's output.

So try it out today by using the **glimmer parser** for Prettier!
