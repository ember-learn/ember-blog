## Welcome to 2024!

It's been an irregular year when it comes to this amazing blog/newsletter. This edition does its best to wrap up some of the important resources released in the last quarter of 2023. It will not cover all the releases of the addons we usually cover. Starting this February we'll try to send out the Ember Times bi-weekly again and we could use your help. If you are interested in writing for the Ember Times, please reach out on [Discord (#support-ember-times)](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/485450546887786506)!

If you are interested in keeping up with all that is going on within the Ember Core teams, you can join the meetings on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/emberjs). Since the last time we published this list, two things changed. The RFC meeting happens twice on Friday to make it more accessible for people in/around the EU timezone. With [Polaris](https://emberjs.com/editions/polaris/) coming up, on Monday you can join this meeting to see how you can contribute to making Polaris a reality.

- Monday - Learning team, **Polaris shepperding meeting**
- Tuesday - Tooling team (combination of CLI & Embroider)
- Thursday - Spec meeting
- Friday - RFC review **(twice)**, EmberData meeting

## [üá™üá∫ Ember Europe: Update on Embroider initiative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPMzrQzryZI)

[Chris Manson (@mansona)](https://github.com/mansona) provided an update on the [Embroider Initiative](https://mainmatter.com/embroider-initiative/)'s progress during his talk at Ember Europe‚Äôs final 2023 Meetup.

He addressed the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) support and demonstrated an Ember app on Vite, explaining the importance of using ESM-compatible dependencies. He also discussed the challenges faced during the integration process, such as add-ons not being fully converted to ESM.

Chris introduced what will be in the [next major release of Embroider](https://github.com/embroider-build/embroider/pull/1701) and encouraged users to remain optimistic despite encountering issues due to cache busting by showcasing debugging techniques and the advantages of Vite's network tab.

## üêπ Addon releases since the 1st of January

- [ember-style-modifier v4](https://github.com/jelhan/ember-style-modifier/releases/tag/v4.0.0). This addon provides a {{style}} element modifier to set the element's style. This allows to set custom CSS of an element without requiring a Content Security Policy style-src-attr: "unsafe-inline". The breaking changes for v4 are dropping support for node versions 14 and 16 and all Ember versions below 4.12.
- [ember-eui v8.0.1](https://github.com/prysmex/ember-eui/releases/tag/v8.0.1) is now a v2 addon with glint signatures, single file components, and pnpm. This addon provides Ember JS components for the Elastic design system.
- [ember-page-title v8.2.0](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title/releases/tag/v8.2.0) now ships its own types! This addon provides a helper for changing the title of the page you're on.
- [pretty-ts-errors v0.5.3](https://github.com/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors/releases/tag/v0.5.3). This VSCode extension makes TypeScript errors prettier and human-readable. The latest version added support for Ember template tag components in `.gjs` and `.gts` files reported by Glint.
- [vsc-ember-syntax v1.0.27]( https://github.com/lifeart/vsc-ember-syntax/releases/tag/v1.0.27) The latest release of the "Glimmer Templates Syntax for VS Code" extension added support for template tags in markdown files. This means you can now use `gjs` and `gts` for code fence blocks and get proper syntax highlighting in your editor.
