👋 Emberistas! 🐹

<SOME-INTRO-HERE-TO-KEEP-THEM-SUBSCRIBERS-READING>
EmberConf is this Monday 🎉

## [EmberConf is this Monday 🎉](https://emberconf.com/)

EmberConf is **the best place** to meet the folks behind the magic, and Virtual EmberConf 2021 is this upcoming Monday and Tuesday! 🙌 [EmberConf](https://emberconf.com/) is two days of Ember talks, sessions and fun -- streaming live virtually everywhere.

Hop onto the [Ember Discord](https://discord.gg/emberjs) to start chatting with your Ember friends in the [#emberconf](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480502413917421570) channel. Starting this Monday, most EmberConf chatter will take place in [#ec-hallway](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/824756378814906435) and the dedicated-per-session channels under the "Virtual EmberConf" category.

Here at the Ember Times, we are super excited about the conference [lineup](https://emberconf.com/schedule/). Monday is an optional day of workshops and BonusConf streams, from "Debugging Your Brain" to "Introducing Template Imports". Tuesday's main event will be a full day of keynotes and technical sessions, including "Ending the Plague of Memory Leaks", "Fast-Track Ember with Fastboot + Embroider", "Typed Ember `extends` Confidence", and more. P.S. It's still possible to attend last minute!

* Tickets are $99. If you are unemployed, laid off, or a student, tickets are only $5. Tell a friend!
* Monday's will include two AMA's and you can submit your questions [here](https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/emberconf-2021-ama-questions/).
    * AMA with [Robert Jackson (@rwjblue)](https://github.com/rwjblue), hosted by [Melanie Sumner (@MelSumner)](https://github.com/melsumner)
    * AMA with [Yehuda Katz (@wycats)](https://github.com/wycats), hosted by [Julia Donaldson (@donaldsonjulia)](https://github.com/donaldsonjulia)
