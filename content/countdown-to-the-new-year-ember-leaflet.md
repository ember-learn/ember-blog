**The first of its kind "Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons" series highlights popular addons in the Ember community. We hope you enjoy learning about fun tools for Ember developers together with us each day!**

## Day 17

In the 17th increment of **Countdown to The New Year** let's take a look at an exciting Ember addon to add **maps** to our apps: **ember-leaflet**!

### What It Does

With `ember-leaflet` we can create useful maps for our web applications. This addon helps us to integrate the functionality of [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly, interactive maps - into our Ember app.

### Why I Like It

Leaflet.js is already a great library built with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. The addon `ember-leaflet` makes the developer experience even better for us: we can build complex, multi-layered street maps directly in our templates using the useful layer components provided by the addon API. This makes creating interactive map experiences much more straightforward and much more fun!

Build your own map using `ember-leaflet` by [checking out the project description on Ember Observer](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-leaflet)!

And if you are already a digital cartographer yourself, we'd love to hear about your experiences using `ember-leaflet` or other map addons in the comments section below!
