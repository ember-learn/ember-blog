## [Video Tutorials: TypeScript Basics With EmberJS 🔤](https://twitter.com/knownasilya/status/1349571457983127561)

[Ilya Radchenko (@knownasilya)](https://github.com/knownasilya) did a couple of videos on getting started with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for your EmberJS applications.

The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QWvhMXMSc) goes through setting up [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) which installs a variety of addons which provides blueprints, types, and the typescript dependency itself. It also adds the `tsconfig.json` file which [provides compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to TypeScript.

The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrCbXW223E) does an in-depth example of using TypeScript in Ember such as making a route, controller, and when using actions and decorators. We also briefly go through where to add global type declarations in your project and other tips for working with TypeScript in your Ember application today.
