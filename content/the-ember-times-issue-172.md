## [Video Tutorials: TypeScript Basics With EmberJS 🔤](https://twitter.com/knownasilya/status/1349571457983127561)

[Ilya Radchenko (@knownasilya)](https://github.com/knownasilya) did a couple of videos on getting started with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for your EmberJS applications.

The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QWvhMXMSc) goes through setting up [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) which installs a variety of addons which provides blueprints, types, and the typescript dependency itself. It also adds the `tsconfig.json` file which [provides compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to TypeScript.

The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrCbXW223E) does an in-depth example of using TypeScript in Ember such as making a route, controller, and when using actions and decorators. We also briefly go through where to add global type declarations in your project and other tips for working with TypeScript in your Ember application today.

## [Storybook for Ember tutorial 🎨](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/get-started/)

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) has taken the world of **design systems** by storm! What is Storybook? Storybook helps you build UI components that are isolated from business logic and context of your app. Sort of a "style guide as a service." Check out the new [Storybook for Ember tutorial](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/get-started/) for guidance on setting up Storybook in your Ember app.

[Thomas Gossmann (@gossi)](https://github.com/gossi) spearheaded the Ember + Storybook effort and wrote a complementary blog post, [Ember with Storybook – Behind the Scenes](https://gos.si/blog/ember-with-storybook-behind-the-scenes/). The post touches on a few ideas:

- How Storybook and Ember are independent build pipelines
- Options for writing Storybook docs in Markdown
- Different strategies for Storybook setup depending on your app architecture (e.g. monorepo vs. multirepo).

But wait, there's more - you can use @gossi's open source Ember design system, hokulea, as a reference!

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hokulea/hokulea)
- [Storybook](https://hokulea.netlify.app/)

Already using Storybook with Ember, or going to try it out in your application? Be sure to check out the [official Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/ember/get-started/introduction) and contribute to the Ember section if you can to further flesh it out!
