## [Video Tutorials: TypeScript Basics With EmberJS 🔤](https://twitter.com/knownasilya/status/1349571457983127561)

[Ilya Radchenko (@knownasilya)](https://github.com/knownasilya) did a couple of videos on getting started with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for your EmberJS applications.

The [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QWvhMXMSc) goes through setting up [ember-cli-typescript](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript) which installs a variety of addons which provides blueprints, types, and the typescript dependency itself. It also adds the `tsconfig.json` file which [provides compiler options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to TypeScript.

The [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrCbXW223E) does an in-depth example of using TypeScript in Ember such as making a route, controller, and when using actions and decorators. We also briefly go through where to add global type declarations in your project and other tips for working with TypeScript in your Ember application today.

## [Storybook for Ember tutorial 🎨](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/get-started/)

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) has taken the world of **design systems** by storm! What is Storybook? Storybook helps you build UI components that are isolated from business logic and context of your app. Sort of a "style guide as a service." Check out the new [Storybook for Ember tutorial](https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/ember/en/get-started/) for guidance on setting up Storybook in your Ember app.

[Thomas Gossmann (@gossi)](https://github.com/gossi) spearheaded the Ember + Storybook effort and wrote a complementary blog post, [Ember with Storybook – Behind the Scenes](https://gos.si/blog/ember-with-storybook-behind-the-scenes/). The post touches on a few ideas:

- How Storybook and Ember are independent build pipelines
- Options for writing Storybook docs in Markdown
- Different strategies for Storybook setup depending on your app architecture (e.g. monorepo vs. multirepo).

But wait, there's more - you can use @gossi's open source Ember design system, hokulea, as a reference!

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hokulea/hokulea)
- [Storybook](https://hokulea.netlify.app/)

Already using Storybook with Ember, or going to try it out in your application? Be sure to check out the [official Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/ember/get-started/introduction) and contribute to the Ember section if you can to further flesh it out!

## [3. Building a Router component for Glimmer.js 🧭](https://dev.to/rajasegar/building-a-router-component-for-glimmer-js-52bk)

[Rajasegar Chandran (@rajasegar)](https://github.com/rajasegar) wrote a blog on building routing components for apps built using Glimmer.js. Unlike Ember, which has built-in routing, Glimmer is only a rendering engine. Rajasegar's blog walks through how routing can be achieved for Glimmer apps. He talks about this Routing system by building a Route Registry, Route component, Link component, and the Router Component.

As a bonus he also mentions about how you can achieve code-splitting JS bundles and lazy loading components.

Read more about [Building a Router component for Glimmer.js](https://dev.to/rajasegar/building-a-router-component-for-glimmer-js-52bk) if you have been looking for routers for your Glimmer apps!

## [Building prototypes with Ember 🐹](https://twitter.com/simplabs/status/1338871240342327296)

If you have not seen the recent [simplabs](https://github.com/simplabs) blog post by [Florian Pichler (@pichfl)](https://github.com/pichfl) on Building prototypes with Ember.js, you may want to give it a read.

Florian's post covers the approach they took in building [ember-hotspots](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-hotspots), an addon that can enable the experience of building prototypes that many design oriented software solutions provide, but in the framework we all know and love, Ember.js! 🔥

The post dives into the details of how to create hotspots and efficiently handle images with preloading, and even discusses a little bit of the Broccoli work involved.

If you're interested, head on over to the [simplabs blog](https://simplabs.com/blog/2020/12/15/building-prototypes-with-emberjs-and-ember-hotspots/) and check out more about `ember-hotspots`!
