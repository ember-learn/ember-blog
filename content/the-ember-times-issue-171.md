## [Ember 3.24 Release 🐹](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-3-24-released/)

Version 3.24  of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI was released on January 7, 2021! Please use the [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

Ember.js 3.24 included [blueprint changes](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/19224) when [ember-page-title](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title) is installed, interface changes to `DeprecationOptions` requiring the keys `for` and `since` when using `deprecate()`, and updated the Glimmer VM to version 0.65.0.

The function `tryInvoke` from `@ember/utils` module has been deprecated in favor of JavaScript's optional chaining `?.` There have also been various deprecations for `Ember.String` methods including the `Ember.String.loc` function. Please check the [Deprecations guide](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x/) for the full information.

Ember Data 3.24 included a fix where an attempt to set something on a deleted record no longer shows the value in the error message in a production environment. This was [done](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/7370) to prevent leaking sensitive data.

Ember CLI 3.24 upgraded the packages that are present in the package.json blueprint to their latest version which included a major version changes for [ember-qunit to v5](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit/releases/tag/v5.0.0) and [eslint-plugin-ember to v10](https://github.com/ember-cli/eslint-plugin-ember/releases/tag/v10.0.0). The addon [ember-page-title](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-page-title) was also added to the blueprint. Finally prettier (along with eslint-config-prettier and eslint-plugin-prettier) was also added to the blueprint from [RFC #628](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0628-prettier.md).

## [Blog: Understanding args in Glimmer Components ✍️](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/understanding-args-in-glimmer-components/)

[Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) wrote a blog post on [understanding `args` in Glimmer components](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/understanding-args-in-glimmer-components/) with a focus on what happens when there are _updates_ to `args`.

Chris explains how a Glimmer component works if you strip away all the reactivity and only do a single pass. The [Glimmer component API](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.23/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent) sets the `args` object on to the class in the `constructor`. The `args` object in a Glimmer component is also **read-only** since it is a [private class field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields) while exposed with a getter.

```javascript
class Component {
  #args: object;
  get args() {
    return this.#args;
  }

  constructor(args: object) {
    this.#args = args;
  }
}
```

The blog recommends to never assign from a property on `args` to a local class field in a Glimmer component because changes to the parent will never be reflected in the component. You should instead use getters that are re-computed when invoked.
