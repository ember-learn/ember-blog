## [Developing Robust Ember.js Applications course on Educative 🆕](https://www.educative.io/courses/robust-ember-js-applications)

Based on the popular book, [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/), Educative has a new (paid) course, [Developing Robust Ember.js Applications](https://www.educative.io/courses/robust-ember-js-applications) by [Balint Erdi (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi). Educative is a growing online platform to level up your coding skills. Their teaching philosophy revolves around "no more passive learning". Instead, the platform offers interactive in-browser environments to keep you engaged and test your progress as you go. 

Takeaway skills:
- Understand how Ember.js works in web applications
- Help the user understand how the different building blocks, including components, routing, and services, make everything work in Ember.js
- Learn how to use Ember CLI
- Learn how to completely develop and Ember.js application

We look forward to giving the course a spin!
