## [Developing Robust Ember.js Applications course on Educative 🆕](https://www.educative.io/courses/robust-ember-js-applications)

Based on the popular book, [Rock and Roll with Ember.js](https://balinterdi.com/rock-and-roll-with-emberjs/), Educative has a new (paid) course, [Developing Robust Ember.js Applications](https://www.educative.io/courses/robust-ember-js-applications) by [Balint Erdi (@balinterdi)](https://github.com/balinterdi). Balint chose to partner with Educative because their courses are **interactive**: there are quizzes and coding challenges at the end of most chapters, which will help reinforce understanding and learning.

Takeaway skills:

- Understand how Ember.js works in web applications
- Help the user understand how the different building blocks, including components, routing, and services, make everything work in Ember.js
- Learn how to use Ember CLI
- Learn how to completely develop and Ember.js application

We look forward to giving the course a spin!

## [Using Ember with XState ❎](https://emerson.github.io/posts/emberjs-with-xstate)

Over the past year, the frontend team at [iManage Closing Folders](https://www.closingfolders.com/) has been experimenting with state machines and Ember. What is a state machine? From [Understanding State Machines on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-machines-basics-of-computer-science-d42855debc66/), a state machine will read a series of inputs. When it reads an input, it will switch to a different state. Each state specifies which state to switch to, for a given input.

In the post [Using EmberJS with XState](https://emerson.github.io/posts/emberjs-with-xstate), [Emerson Lackey (@Emerson)](https://github.com/Emerson) discusses the benefits and drawbacks of state machines. For example, state machines provide a framework-agnostic way of defining presentational state. State machines eliminate emergent states in favor or explicit states. For example, if you have two boolean states on a component, `isSaving` and `isError`, you actually have four states to consider.

Emerson walks through an example of how to use [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) and Ember to implement a signup form. We appreciate the detailed code walkthrough, and agree that the state visualizations are definitely awesome! In addition to the writeup, check out the accompanying full source of [emberjs-state-example on GitHub](https://github.com/Emerson/emberjs-xstate-example).

## [Let codemods upgrade your app and deal with jQuery 🤖](https://twitter.com/jwwweber/status/1415062325149720578)

Another **must-read tutorial** for anyone who is **building and maintaining Ember applications** is coming your way:

In her article ["Remodeling an Ember App - Codemods and jQuery"](https://www.jenweber.dev/remodeling-an-ember-app---codemods) Ember core team member [Jen Weber (@jenweber)](https://github.com/jenweber) teaches you where to find **codemods** and how to use them for upgrades of your Ember app. Additionally, you will learn how you can make your app [exclude the jQuery dependency automatically](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/configuring-ember/optional-features/#toc_jquery-integration) to save a few extra kilobytes on your builds!

Read the full article [here](https://www.jenweber.dev/remodeling-an-ember-app---codemods) (or alternatively on [dev.to](https://dev.to/jenweber/remodeling-an-ember-app-codemods-and-jquery-3e8k)) and if this tutorial helped you with your own upgrade, be sure to [share your experience on the post announcement](https://twitter.com/jwwweber/status/1415062325149720578)!
