## üéä New addons & libraries

- [ember-flash-notifications](https://ember-flash-notifications.vercel.app/) is a new addon that brings flash messages using the native [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API). This means it works across all latest browsers, but might not work for older devices or browsers.
- [ember-awesome-icons] is just like the previous addon created by [Alexei Panov (@alexeipanov)](https://github.com/alexeipanov) and allows you to easily create components for free FontAwesome icons. This way you don't need to include all the icons in your bundle. Just the icons you need, fast as HTML and highly customizable with CSS, and SVG powers!
- [ember-phosphor-icons](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/ember-phosphor-icons) created by [Ignace Maes (@IgnaceMaes)](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes) to give you access to the [phosphor iconset](https://phosphoricons.com). The addon has TypeScript & Glint support. When used with Embroider it gives you all the benefits of tree shaking to keep your bundle size small.
- [form-data-utils](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/form-data-utils) is now its own thing and has been extracted from `ember-primitives`. It's a utility function for extracting the FormData as an object from the native `<form>` element, allowing more ergonomic of usage of default forms and fields. You can checkout the example in the [documentation](https://ember-primitives.pages.dev/6-utils/data-from-event.md)
- [ember-codemod-remove-inject-as-service](https://github.com/ijlee2/ember-codemod-remove-inject-as-service) created by [Isaac Lee (@ijlee2)](https://github.com/ijlee2) helps you to standardize how you inject service. Replace `inject` with `service`, `!` with `declare` in TS files, and remove `private` and `readonly` keywords in TS files. You can use `service` since Ember 4.1 and `inject` is planned to be deprecated in Ember v6.
- [ember-engines-router-service](https://github.com/villander/ember-engines-router-service) created by [Michael Villander (@villander)](https://github.com/villander) provides an API for authoring a Router service, when you are using `ember-engines`. You will have the full `RouterService` API inside each engine. That means you can use APIs such as `transitionTo` and `isActive`, plus the new "external routing" APIs such as `transitionToExternal` and `isActiveExternal` which help link `externalRoutes` together.
- [ember-addon-v2-scanner](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/ember-addon-v2-scanner) created by [Ignace Maes (@IgnaceMaes)](https://github.com/IgnaceMaes) is a CLI tool to scan your Ember project for addons that have a v2 version available. Just run `npx ember-addon-v2-scanner@latest` and check out the results!

## üåü Addon updates

- [ember-qunit v8.1.0](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit/releases/tag/v8.1.0) now ships with a `theme` config option that allows you to use the `qunit-theme-ember` to give your tests a real EmberJS look.
- [ember-a11y-refocus v4.1.0](https://github.com/ember-a11y/ember-a11y-refocus) provides some dependency updates, updated documentation (in the README), and a new flag called `excludeAllQueryParams`, an optional flag that will allow you to opt completely out of route evaluation (for transition announcements or focus management) if query params are involved. The new feature will allow some older apps to use the addon while they refactor code to allow them to simply use the addon w/o any customizations.
- [ember-can v5](https://github.com/minutebase/ember-can/releases/tag/v5.0.0) converts the addon to v2 and it now supports TypeScript!
- [ember-string v4](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-string/releases/tag/v4.0.0-%40ember%2Fstring) converts the addon to v2.
- [ember-intl v7.x](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl/releases/tag/v7.0.0) has entered a new era with it's 7.x series. This new major brings you a minimized API (to improve onboarding and project maintainability), provides native types for improved TS and Glint support and adds better documentation. To upgrade check out the [migration guide](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/docs/migration/v7).
- To support your developer experience you can use the `Ember Language Server` VSCode extention. The latest update supports template-lint configs in `mjs` format. If you are still using `lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable` you can migrate to `embertooling.vscode-ember`.
- [NullVoxPopuli/eslint-configs v4](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/eslint-configs) are [Preston Sego (@NullVoxPopuli)](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli)'s preferred ESLint configs for all their projects. They use only overrides so that they're easy to maintain and update. Version 4 now supports `gjs` and `gts` out of the box.
- [ember-sortable v5.1.0](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-sortable/releases/tag/v5.1.0-ember-sortable) adds the feature that allows you to create a sortable list that works with a grid. Items can be moved up, down, right, or left within the same list.

## [üì¶ EmberData v5.3.x](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v5.3.4)

We are happy to inform you about this massive improvement that shipped to EmberData. Since v5.3.4:

- it ships fully as v2-addons,
- all packages ship native types,
- mirror packages are now available for 5.3,
- a new cli tool has been added to helpquickly configure your 4.x project for typescript,
- `ember-inflector` and `@ember/string` are no longer project dependencies.

Dive into the details of the [latest release](https://github.com/emberjs/data/releases/tag/v5.3.4) now.

## [üîì Security fix for ember-cli-polyfill-io](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-cli-polyfill-io/pull/10)

Delivering polyfills from `polyfill.io` has turned into a service provider attack against users of your apps. An update to [ember-cli-polyfill](https://github.com/alexlafroscia/ember-cli-polyfill-io) will be released to fix this. You can also right now change your config by changing the `src` for `polyfill-io config` in `ember-cli-build.js` to `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js`. Also make sure you need this dependency, removing it removes the risk completely!

## [üìö Documentation on Template Tag Format](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-tag-format/)

The [Ember guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/) now include extensive information about our [`<template>` tag format](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-tag-format/). The template tag format is a powerful, new way to write components in Ember. It's a single-file format that combines the component's JavaScript and Glimmer template code. The <template> tag is used to keep a clear separation between the template language and the JavaScript around it. If you want to know more about this, check out the [documentation](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/template-tag-format/).

---

## [üß± Documentation on Named Blocks](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/block-content/#toc_named-blocks)

If you want to yield content to different spots in the same component, you can use named blocks. However our guides were lacking information on how to do this. Thanks to [Shirin Boomi (@Shishouille)](https://github.com/Shishouille) you can now learn how to use it and make the most of `yield`ing information throughout your components.
