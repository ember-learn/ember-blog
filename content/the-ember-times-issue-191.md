## [Ember.js Template Imports Blog Series 📚](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/)

There's a fantastic new 5 part series from [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) on template imports that goes into great detail comparing the various options for template imports that are on the table for the Ember and Glimmer community while we are experimenting with designs for components being available in the same file (you may have heard to this referred to as single-file components).

So far, 4 parts of the 5 part series have been published and the posts cover an introduction on the formats, comparisons on teaching and understanding, tooling considerations and integrated testing.

As is typical of the content Chris puts out, the discussion in this series is precise, thoughtful and complex. It will teach you a lot about single file components and what is involved in the decision making behind making such an important choice for our community.

Many thanks to Chris for putting the thought process out there for all of us to better understand the options.

You can find the 4 parts already published, here:

- [Part 1, an introduction](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/part-1/)
- [Part 2, teaching and understanding components](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/part-2/)
- [Part 3, tradeoffs on tooling](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/part-3/)
- [Part 4, integrated testing](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/ember-template-imports/part-4/)

## [Release of uELS 3.0.8 published to VSCode ✅](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480499624663056390/896699510888226826)

[Unstable Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable) is a fully featured fork of Ember Language Server. While the name says _unstable_, it actually is **stable** and recently [published v3.0.8 to VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable)!

Thank you to [Alex Kanunnikov (@lifeart)](https://github.com/lifeart) for the updates such as: async file system access, improved startup performance, fixed found issues, and multiple file system providers support.

As part of the release, it added experimental [VSCode web-version support](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions). This allows uELS to be integrated into any browser environment.
