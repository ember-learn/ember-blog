## [Release of uELS 3.0.8 published to VSCode ✅](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480499624663056390/896699510888226826)

[Unstable Ember Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable) is a fully featured fork of Ember Language Server. While the name says _unstable_, it actually is **stable** and recently [published v3.0.8 to VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable)!

Thank you to [Alex Kanunnikov (@lifeart)](https://github.com/lifeart) for the updates such as: async file system access, improved startup performance, fixed found issues, and multiple file system providers support.

As part of the release, it added experimental [VSCode web-version support](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions). This allows uELS to be integrated into any browser environment.
