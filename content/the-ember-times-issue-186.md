## [Blog Post: Avoiding Lifecycle in Components ‚úçÔ∏è](https://twitter.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1421128258427490311)

[NullVoxPopuli (@NullVoxPopuli)](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli) published a blog post on [Avoiding Lifecycle in Components](https://nullvoxpopuli.com/avoiding-lifecycle), namely the lifecycle hooks that come with [ember-render-modifiers](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-render-modifiers).

For some context, ember-render-modifiers was created from [RFC 415: Render Element Modifiers](https://emberjs.github.io/rfcs/0415-render-element-modifiers.html) which introduced  three new generic element modifiers: `{{did-insert}}`, `{{did-update}}`, and `{{will-destroy}}`. The caveat however was that these modifiers were meant for quickly migrating away from classic Ember components to Glimmer components, because they largely allow you to use the same lifecycle hook methods you've already written while attaching them to these modifiers.

The blog outlines several possibilities to avoid using these modifiers:

- Creating your own custom modifier when behavior is tied to a particular DOM node or DOM tree
- Starting Ember 3.25, using a local modifier which is only referenced within your component
- Using `useFunction` from [ember-resources](https://github.com/NullVoxPopuli/ember-resources) to lazily load data instead of doing it in `did-insert` or `did-update` modifiers
- Handling destruction using `registerDestructor` from [@ember/destroyable](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/modules/@ember%2Fdestroyable) or using `willDestroy` directly from the [Glimmer lifecycle hook](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent#willdestroy)

## [`ember-responsive-image` v3 release üñº](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-responsive-image)

Optimising image size and formats to improve performance can get complicated, but the [`ember-responsive-image`](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-responsive-image) addon has your back! Now you have even more reason to take advantage of its abilities following the annoucement by [Simon Ihmig (@simonihmig)](https://github.com/simonihmig) of [version 3](https://github.com/kaliber5/ember-responsive-image/releases/tag/v3.0.0). This release provides support for Cloudinary and imgix image CDNs, further enriching a full set of functionality for re-sizing images and optimizing image loading times across all browsers. Go check it out.

## [Announcing Glimmer Apollo üéâ](https://glimmer-apollo.com/)

[Josemar Luedke (@josemarluedke)](https://github.com/josemarluedke) shared [Glimmer Apollo](https://glimmer-apollo.com/) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josemarluedke/status/1410295473072611328), a new addon that integrates GraphQL in your Ember and Glimmer apps with a declarative API to query, mutate, and access GraphQL data.

For background, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) is a popular, declarative data-fetching library for GraphQL. Glimmer Apollo uses the concept of [Resources](https://www.pzuraq.com/introducing-use/) to enable the integration of Glimmer's autotracking system with Apollo Client. The library is also reactive: queries are automatically re-executed when arguments change. The UI reflects any changes when cache data are updated.

Glimmer Apollo is written in TypeScript, allowing APIs to specify the shape of the result data and variables. TypeScript also has friendly IntelliSense while coding. Glimmer Apollo is also an **Embroider native addon** (v2) and integrates with FastBoot (server-side rendering). üíØ
