👋 Emberistas! 🐹

<SOME-INTRO-HERE-TO-KEEP-THEM-SUBSCRIBERS-READING>
Ember 4.0 released 🐹,

---

## [Ember 4.0 released 🐹](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-0-released)

Ember released version 4.0 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. Ember's 4.0 release focuses the framework by removing long-deprecated APIs and support for legacy platforms.

While [Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) APIs have been the default for new applications since Ember 3.15, the framework has continued to support "Classic" framework features in accordance with its semantic versioning commitment. Ember 4.0 takes a step forward and drops already-deprecated classic APIs, however the foundational [EmberComponent](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Component) and [EmberObject](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/EmberObject)/[computed](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed/methods) APIs are not removed in this release.

Notable changes in the Ember 4.0 release includes:
- Dropping Internet Explorer (IE) [browser support](https://emberjs.com/browser-support/)
- [ember-auto-import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import) is a required dependency
- `Ember.assign` is deprecated in Ember 4.0 and will be removed in Ember 5.0
- No new public APIs, only bug fixes and removal of previously [deprecated public APIs](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x/)
- Ember Data also removed previously [deprecated public APIs](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/ember-data/v3.x/)

For more details on the changes in Ember.js 4.0, please review the [Ember.js 4.0.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v4.0.0).
