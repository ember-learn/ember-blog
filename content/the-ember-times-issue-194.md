👋 Emberistas! 🐹

Ember 4.0 released 🐹,
New Episodes of Whiskey, Web and Whatnot 🎙,

## [Ember 4.0 released 🐹](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-0-released)

Ember released version 4.0 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI. Ember's 4.0 release focuses the framework by removing long-deprecated APIs and support for legacy platforms.

While [Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/) APIs have been the default for new applications since Ember 3.15, the framework has continued to support "Classic" framework features in accordance with its semantic versioning commitment. Ember 4.0 takes a step forward and drops already-deprecated classic APIs, however the foundational [EmberComponent](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/Component) and [EmberObject](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/EmberObject)/[computed](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release/classes/@ember%2Fobject%2Fcomputed/methods) APIs are not removed in this release.

Notable changes in the Ember 4.0 release includes:

- Dropping Internet Explorer (IE) [browser support](https://emberjs.com/browser-support/)
- [ember-auto-import](https://github.com/ef4/ember-auto-import) is a required dependency
- `Ember.assign` is deprecated in Ember 4.0 and will be removed in Ember 5.0
- No new public APIs, only bug fixes and removal of previously [deprecated public APIs](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v3.x/)
- Ember Data also removed previously [deprecated public APIs](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/ember-data/v3.x/)

For more details on the changes in Ember.js 4.0, please review the [Ember.js 4.0.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v4.0.0).

In [another episode](https://www.whiskeywebandwhatnot.fm/robbies-origin-story-learning-to-code-learning-to-hire-and-taking-the-entrepreneurial-leap/), the gang behind Whiskey Web and Whatnot also had a chance to chat with each other and talk about the trajectory of Robert's career and how he was introduced to Ember.js, how Robert's fondness for Ember has grown over time through the strength of the community 💛🧡💜💚💙, how he got involved with the Ember Learning Team and a whole lot more!
