**This is the twelfth in our December series–"Countdown to The New Year: 31 Days of Ember Addons". We plan to highlight a new addon each day until the new year, and we hope you'll join us for the fun!**

## Day 12

Today we're highlighting [`ember-svg-jar`](https://www.emberobserver.com/addons/ember-svg-jar).

### What It Does

There's a reason `ember-svg-jar` has a 10 out of 10 on Ember Observer! The `ember-svg-jar` addon enables you to effortlessly use SVG images in Ember apps.

### Why We Like It

A common theme in the Ember community is zero configuration. In that vein, with `ember-svg-jar`, you get a visual workflow out of the box to search and preview icons in one place. Check out the [live demo](https://svgjar-demo.web.app/) and empower your team with this feature!

The `ember-svg-jar` addon helps you reduce the size of your assets. Using [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo), SVGs are automatically optimized, which can cut your file size by half or more. So useful!

The addon is flexible and extensible. ember-svg-jar provides an easy-to-use helper `{{svg-jar "asset-name"}}`, support for both `inline` and `symbol` embedding methods, and the ability to copy SVG as CSS background.

The addon [webpage](https://svgjar.web.app/) and [README](https://github.com/ivanvotti/ember-svg-jar) are a dream to peruse, both well documented and beautiful! And the logo is certainly bringing us joy.

Do you use ember-svg-jar? Or one like it? We'd love to hear about Ember addons you love for DecEmber!
