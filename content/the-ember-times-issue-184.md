Introducing the a11y-disabled-modifier Modifier 💚,

## [Introducing the a11y-disabled-modifier Modifier 💚](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480499624663056390/842592654696382474)

<!--alex disable invalid-->
Inspired by the [CSSTricks](https://css-tricks.com/) blog post on [Making Disabled Buttons More Inclusive](https://css-tricks.com/making-disabled-buttons-more-inclusive/), [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho/) created the [a11y-disabled-modifier](https://github.com/chriskrycho/a11y-disabled-modifier) addon.

The blog post argues against the `disabled` attribute in `<button>` in favor of the `aria-disabled` attribute since it does not prevent clicking and focusing on the button which is useful when you are navigating the site using the Tab key.

This modifier implements accessible and usable button-disabling by adding `aria-disabled="true"` to the target element when the `when` named argument is truthy. It will also stop any clicks on the button from propagating and ensures form submission does not trigger.

```hbs
<form {{on "submit" this.submit}}>
  <label>some text: <input type='text' /></label>
  <button type='submit' {{disabled when=this.isInvalid}}>submit</button>
</form>
```

Try it out today by running `ember install a11y-disabled-modifier` on your Ember app!
