## [The Road to Ember 4.0 üõ£](https://blog.emberjs.com/the-road-to-ember-4-0/)

[Matthew Beale (@mixonic)](https://github.com/mixonic) from the Ember Core Framework and Steering Committee [teams](https://emberjs.com/teams/), writes about [The Road to Ember 4.0](https://blog.emberjs.com/the-road-to-ember-4-0/) on the official Ember blog.

- **Announcing Ember 4.0**: Ember 4.0 will be released around September 20th. Ember 4.4 will be the first LTS candidate of the 4.x series.
- **Whats in a 4.0?**: As a major version of Ember, there are no new features. This sections discusses the removal of deprecated APIs. For example, `Ember.Logger` is removed in favor of native console APIs. Also, `sendAction` is removed in favor of calling closure actions like any other callback.
- **Planning your upgrade to 4.0**: Consider using the [ember-cli-deprecation-workflow](https://github.com/mixonic/ember-cli-deprecation-workflow) addon as part of your upgrade process.
- **Contributing to Ember 4.0**: Join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/emberjs) in the #dev-ember-js, #dev-ember-data, #dev-ember-cli, or #dev-ember-learning channels to find out how you can contribute.

Please check out the [detailed post](https://blog.emberjs.com/the-road-to-ember-4-0/) in full for more details on how you can prepare for your upgrade!

> We're looking forward to working with the community on Ember 4.0 and on the opportunities beyond it. As always we appreciate your support, your trust, and our common partnership.

## [Introducing the a11y-disabled-modifier Modifier üíö](https://discord.com/channels/480462759797063690/480499624663056390/842592654696382474)

<!--alex disable invalid-->
Inspired by the [CSSTricks](https://css-tricks.com/) blog post on [Making Disabled Buttons More Inclusive](https://css-tricks.com/making-disabled-buttons-more-inclusive/), [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho/) created the [a11y-disabled-modifier](https://github.com/chriskrycho/a11y-disabled-modifier) addon.

The blog post argues against the `disabled` attribute in `<button>` in favor of the `aria-disabled` attribute since it does not prevent clicking and focusing on the button which is useful when you are navigating the site using the Tab key.

This modifier implements accessible and usable button-disabling by adding `aria-disabled="true"` to the target element when the `when` named argument is truthy. It will also stop any clicks on the button from propagating and ensures form submission does not trigger.

```handlebars
<form {{on "submit" this.submit}}>
  <label>some text: <input type='text' /></label>
  <button type='submit' {{disabled when=this.isInvalid}}>submit</button>
</form>
```

Try it out today by running `ember install a11y-disabled-modifier` on your Ember app!
