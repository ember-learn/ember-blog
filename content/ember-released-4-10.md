Today the Ember project is releasing version 4.10 of Ember.js, Ember Data, and Ember CLI.

This release kicks off the 4.11 beta cycle for all sub-projects. We encourage our community (especially addon authors) to help test these beta builds and report any bugs before they are published as a final release in six weeks' time. The [ember-try](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try) addon is a great way to continuously test your projects against the latest Ember releases.

For more details on changes in Ember.js 4.10, please review the [Ember.js 4.10.0 release page](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/releases/tag/v4.10.0).

## Ember Data

Ember Data is the official data persistence library for Ember.js applications.

### Changes in Ember Data 4.10

Due to low availability for the Ember Data team this cycle, Ember Data does not have a new release, so it remains at 4.9.

Please see the [Ember 4.0 release blog post](https://blog.emberjs.com/ember-4-9-released) for details about v4.9 of Ember Data.

---

## Ember CLI

Ember CLI is the command line interface for managing and packaging Ember.js applications.

### Upgrading Ember CLI

You may upgrade Ember CLI using the `ember-cli-update` project:

```bash
npx ember-cli-update
```

This utility will help you to update your app or addon to the latest Ember CLI version. You will probably encounter merge conflicts, in which the default behavior is to let you resolve conflicts on your own. For more information on the `ember-cli-update` project, see [the GitHub README](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-update).

While it is recommended to keep Ember CLI versions in sync with Ember and Ember Data, this is not required. After updating ember-cli, you can keep your current version(s) of Ember or Ember Data by editing `package.json` to revert the changes to the lines containing `ember-source` and `ember-data`.
