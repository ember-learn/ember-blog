## [Getting Ember API Docs Ready for Octane 📖](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc/pull/52)

People have been hard at work ⚒ getting the [Ember API Docs](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/release) ready for Ember Octane! A few good examples of this are the recently merged PR's by [Chris Garrett @pzuraq](https://github.com/pzuraq) and [Sivakumar Kailasam @sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) in [ember-cli-yuidoc](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc) to allow YUIDoc to support decorators within markdown blocks.

For those who don't know, [YUIDoc](https://github.com/yui/yuidoc) is a JavaScript documentation tool that the **Ember API Docs** use to provide the helpful documentation for the framework that we in the Ember community rely upon, so this is great news that work is being done to support Octane.  

It actually takes a lot of effort to maintain the Ember API Docs and keep them updated and reflecting modern JS practices, so here's a big shout out 🎉 to [Todd Jordan @toddjordan](https://github.com/toddjordan) and [Sivakumar Kailasam @sivakumar-kailasam](https://github.com/sivakumar-kailasam) who have led the charge, and all the other contributors who have helped along the way.

Also, many thanks to [Miguel Camba @cibernox](https://github.com/cibernox) the maintainer of ember-cli-yuidoc, and [Robert Jackson @rwjblue](https://github.com/rwjblue), for their help in getting this valuable work across the line.

If you want to checkout the PR's you can find them [here](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc/pull/52) and [here](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc/pull/53).
