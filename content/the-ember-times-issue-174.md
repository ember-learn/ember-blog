## [Release of ember-browser-services ⚙️](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-browser-services)

The [ember-browser-services](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-browser-services) addon is officially released! The addon provides a collection of [Ember Services](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/services/) that allow for consistent interaction with browser APIs. This provides consistent interaction with browser APIs and easier testing.

For tests, you can stub out the Ember Service from ember-browser-services with your own implementation in order to verify the behavior you were testing. Any changes to a service's implementation during a test are discarded after the test finishes, there’s even a shorthand way of doing so using the `setupBrowserFakes` export.

Try out [ember-browser-services](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ember-browser-services) today by checking out their code on GitHub!
