## Ember Addon Roundup 🌐

- [Chris Thoburn (@runspired)](https://github.com/runspired) released [Flexi 3.0 beta](https://github.com/html-next/flexi) after almost 5 years of hiatus! Flexi is a responsive-design layout framework focused on performance and maintainability, utilizing Ember for greater configuration and convenience. This release supports Ember 3.28+.

Frontile aims to provide the legos (components, helpers, modifiers, and styles) necessary for building consistent and powerful Ember.js apps while following best practices from the community and providing both low-level and high-level components for your application. This release adds Embroider support!
- [Giles Thompson (@gilest)](https://github.com/gilest) released [Ember File Upload v5](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-file-upload/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Ember File Upload is an Ember addon that helps upload files by managing uploads through queues in the background. This release provides Ember Octane, v4 and Embroider support. Check the [upgrade guide](https://ember-file-upload.pages.dev/docs/upgrade-guide#upgrading-to-v5) for more information.
- [Chris Krycho (@chriskrycho)](https://github.com/chriskrycho) released [ember-modifier v3.2.0](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier/releases/tag/v3.2.0) which aligns the modifier design with the rest of the Ember ecosystem and improves its TypeScript support (including with Glint). Check the [changelog](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier/releases/tag/v3.2.0) for full details and the [migration guide](https://github.com/ember-modifier/ember-modifier/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md#40) for how to upgrade your code!
