## ✨ All addons to v2

With all the work on embroider more and more addons are publishing major versions in which they upgrade to be a v2 addon. 

This week we highlight: 
- [ember-cli-flash (v5.0.0)](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-cli-flash/releases/tag/v5.0.0-ember-cli-flash) is an Ember addon that adds a flash message service and component to your app and is now also a v2 addon.
- [ember-set-helper (v3.0.0)](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/ember-set-helper/releases/tag/v3.0.0-ember-set-helper). The `{{set}}` helper returns a function that sets a value. This can be used in combination with Ember's `{{on}}` modifier or component actions to update state without having to write your own custom action.
- [ember-concurrency (v4.0.0)](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency/releases/tag/4.0.0) has been converted to a v2 addon and ships Glint types.

## [📚 Learning EmberJS at AuditBoard](https://abengineering.medium.com/learning-emberjs-at-auditboard-aebb8ade97b1)

Jacob Beltran ([@jacob-beltran](https://github.com/jacob-beltran)) joined AuditBoard about 1,5 years ago and was surprised to find EmberJS being used "still". In this [blogpost](https://abengineering.medium.com/learning-emberjs-at-auditboard-aebb8ade97b1) he will highlight why he deciced to work with Ember.

1. Good people make you better.
2. Interesting problems are framework-agnostic.

And he leaves us with aan important lesson: "Sometimes **leveling up** means taking a step back and **becoming a beginner** again.".

## [🐹 Help the adopted-ember-addons](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/program-guidelines/issues/28)

Melanie Sumner ([@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner)) asks for your help! In the Ember community we believe that it's important to care for addons that need a new maintainer. This is why we have the [Adopted Ember addons program](https://github.com/adopted-ember-addons/program-guidelines). Currently this progam is caring for a lot of addons that are not all in line when it comes to release processes, their CI workflow, and branch names. If you are willing to help review PRs, submit PRs to improve addons, or even evaluate addons for retirement, please reach out to Melanie Sumner ([@MelSumner](https://github.com/MelSumner))!
